If you\&apos;re feeling\ncreative, and your favorite number hasn\&apos;t been taken already, you can\nmake a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non-\nbase-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not\nthat you won\&apos;t get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)\n\nOh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You\&apos;ll\njust be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole\nnet, and you\&apos;ll look like a clueless newbie too.\n\nBy now you\&apos;re probably asking &quot;So who\&apos;s the KotL already?&quot;. Well, as\nJohn Sloan notes below, that\&apos;s about the only real &quot;secret&quot; left around\nhere, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,\nnor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was\nthe original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the\nKotL\&apos;s first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely\nwith hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line-\noriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting\nmessages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with &quot;weenie\nmailers&quot;). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a\nDead-Head.\n\n***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************\n\nOnce you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically\ngroveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed\nwork for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting\nsomething done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)\ndays, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of\neconomic activity on the part of the KotL\&apos;s employers, sending yet\nanother copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it\njust makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an\nexcersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least\nannotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request\nwas submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think\nthe KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).\n\n***********************************************************************\n\nOne more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren\&apos;t what\nthey used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya?\nThe typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, &amp;\ne-mail address. For example:\n\n0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM\n\n(PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only\nrequirements for DoD membership, that\&apos;s not strictly true these days, as\nthere are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)\n\nBlaine (Dances With Bikers) Gardner   blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n            &quot;Denizens of Doom&quot;, by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)\n\n      [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce\&apos;s permission]\n\nThere is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal \nthings that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and  \nmotorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  \nhelmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve\nseats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, \ntraffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double \nentendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They \nargue with each other and plan rides together.\n\nThe difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, \nalthough they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each \nother face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world \nand communicate with each other electronically via computer.\n\nThe computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  \nthe people range from college and university students to high-tech industry \nprofessionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, \nrec.motorcycles (pronounced &quot;wreck-dot-motorcycles,&quot; it\&apos;s the file name for \nthe group\&apos;s primary on-line &quot;meeting place&quot;) carries about 2250 articles per \nmonth;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent \nposters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred \nto as the DoD.\n\nThe DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of \nparodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer \nenthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, &quot;Denizen \nof Doom.&quot;  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of \nthe Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of \ncourse, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.\n\nThe idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules \nappealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the \nList, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been \nalmost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and \nCanada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, \nGermany, Norway and Finland.\n\nKeeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run \nof 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the \nAmerican Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- \nselling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a \nfew months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were \ndonated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 \nto the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs \nin the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.\n\nAs often as possible, the DoD\&apos;ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go \nriding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of \nDoD\&apos;ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California\&apos;s \n&quot;Silicon Valley.&quot;  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on \nRollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California \n&quot;Joust.&quot;\n\nThe Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big \nbarbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern \nCalifornia ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, \nmeeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan \nfor 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction \nwith the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.\n\nThough it\&apos;s a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective \ncommunications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional \nmotorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in \nsearch of two-wheeled camaraderie, it\&apos;s a great way for kindred spirits to \nget together.  Long may they flame.\n\n\n&quot;Live to Flame -- Flame to Live&quot;\t[centerbar]\n\nThis official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which \nyou can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do \nanything like that face to face.  These insults are known as &quot;flames&quot;;  \nissuing them is called &quot;flaming.&quot;  Flames often start when a member \ndisagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A \ntypical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be \nsomething like:  &quot;What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad \nposeur!&quot;  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense \nof the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding \nability and your cat.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_\n\n                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011\n\nPeriodically the question &quot;What is DoD?&quot; is raised. This is one of\nthose questions in the same class as &quot;Why is the sky blue?&quot;, &quot;If there\nis a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?&quot; and &quot;Why do\nwomen inevitably tell you that you\&apos;re such a nice guy just before they\ndump you?&quot;, the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,\nand philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion\nby philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the\nhalls of academe for generations. \n\nA long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few\nminutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on\na computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two\nmachines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another\nvia a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but\nwho was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of\nthe various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and\nsigned it &quot;The Denizen of Doom&quot;. Not wishing to identify himself, he\nasked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time\nbecome DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit\nabout what other people thought and generally being a right thinking\nindividual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. \n\nHe who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was\nthe funniest thing he\&apos;d seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty\neasily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom\nMotorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership\nnumber. \n\nPerhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a\nmotorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or\nmake or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized\nelectronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a\npart of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a\ngestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the\nsum of its parts.  It could also be that we\&apos;re all computer nerds who\nwear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen\nto also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight\nratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open\nminded enough to accept us as members. \n\nIn a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom\nMotorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have\nnever met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet\nfeel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some\nof the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized\nand run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the\nnetwork via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list\n(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the\nsame region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating\naround the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by\n#11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and\ndistributed on VHS by #18)! \n\nWhere will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,\nplacing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine\nmanagement computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each\nparticipant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?\nWill the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal\nroom and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell. \n\nThe DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net\naccess and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only\nask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few\nreally good club secrets). New members will receive via email a\nmembership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which\nincludes name, state, and email address. \n\nThe Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least\nuntil next year when we may decided to change the name). \n\n                  Live to Flame - Flame to Live\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     The DoD daemon as seen on the patches, pins, etc. by\n\n\tChuck Rogers,  car377@druhi.att.com,  DoD #0003\n \n\n                :-(           DoD            )-: \n               :-(  x    __         __    x   )-:      \n              :-(  x    / /         \\ \\    x   )-:     \n             :-(  x    / / -\\-----/- \\ \\    x   )-:    \n            :-(  L     | \\/  \\   /  \\/ |     F   )-:   \n            :-(  I     | /    \\ /    \\ |     L   )-:   \n            :-(  V     \\/ __   /   __ \\/     A   )-:   \n            :-(  E     / /  \\     /  \\ \\     M   )-:   \n            :-(        | |   \\   /   | |     E   )-:   \n            :-(  T     | | . | _ | . | |         )-:   \n            :-(  O     | \\___// \\\\___/ |     T   )-:   \n            :-(         \\     \\_/     /      O   )-:   \n            :-(  F       \\___     ___/           )-:   \n            :-(  L        \\ \\     / /        L   )-:   \n            :-(  A         \\ vvvvv /         I   )-:   \n            :-(  M         | (   ) |         V   )-:   \n            :-(  E         | ^^^^^ |         E   )-:   \n             :-(  x        \\_______/        x   )-:    \n              :-(  x                       x   )-:     \n               :-(  x   rec.motorcycles   x   )-:\n                :-(          USENET          )-:\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                      The DoD\n\n              by the Denizen of Doom    DoD #1\n \nWelcome one and all to the flamingest, most wonderfullest newsgroup of\nall time: wreck.mudder-disciples or is it reak.mudder-disciples? The\nNames have been changes to protect the Guilty (riders) and Innocent\n(the bikes) alike. If you think you recognize a contorted version of\nyour name, you don\&apos;t. It\&apos;s just your guilt complex working against\nyou. Read \&apos;em and weep. \n\nWe tune in on a conversation between some of our heros. Terrible\nBarbarian is extolling the virtues of his Hopalonga Puff-a-cane to\nReverend Muck Mudgers and Stompin Fueling-Injection: \n\nTerrible: This Hopalonga is the greatest... Beats BMWs dead!! \n\nMuck: I don\&apos;t mean to preach, Terrible, but lighten up on the BMW\n     crowd eh?  I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer\n     11 but what the heck.  \n\nStompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that\&apos;s all man.\n\nTerrible: Nahhhh, you\&apos;re sounding like Heritick Ratatnack! Hey, at\n     least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor!\n     Not as good as a Puff-a-cane, should have been called a\n     Woosh-a-stream.\n\nStompin: You mean Wee-Stream.\n\nTerrible: Waddya going to do? Call in reinforcements???\n\nStompin: Yehh man. Here comes Arlow Scarecrow and High Tech. Let\&apos;s see\n     what they say, eh? \n\nMuck: Now men, let\&apos;s try to be civil about this.\n\nHigh Tech: Hi, I\&apos;m a 9 and the BMW is the greatest.\n\nArlow: Other than my B.T. I love my BMW!\n\nTerrible: B.T.???\n\nArlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own.\n\nMuck: Ahhh, look, you\&apos;re making Terrible gag.\n\nTerrible: What does BMW stand for anyway??? \n\nMuck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm.\n\nTerrible: Actually, my name is Terrible. Hmmm, I don\&apos;t know either.\n\nMuck: Say, here comes Chunky Bear.\n\nChunky: Hey, Hey, Hey! Smarter than your average bear!\n\nTerrible: Hey, didn\&apos;t you drop your BMW???\n\nChunky: All right eh, a little BooBoo, but I left him behind. I mean \n     even Villy Ogle flamed me for that! \n\nMuck: It\&apos;s okay, we all makes mistakes.\n\nOut of the blue the West coasters arrive, led by Tread Orange with\nDill Snorkssy, Heritick Ratatnack, Buck Garnish, Snob Rasseller and\nthe perenial favorite: Hooter Boobin Brush! \n\nHeritick: Heya Terrible, how\&apos;s yer front to back bias?\n\nTerrible: Not bad, sold yer BMW?\n\nHeritick: Nahhh.\n\nHooter: Hoot, Hoot.\n\nBuck: Nice tree Hooter, how\&apos;d ya get up there?\n\nHooter: Carbujectors from Hell!!!\n\nMuck: What\&apos;s a carbujector?\n\nHooter: Well, it ain\&apos;t made of alumican!!! Made by Tilloslert!!\n\nMuck: Ahh, come on down, we aren\&apos;t going to flame ya, honest!!\n\nDill: Well, where do we race?\n\nSnob: You know, Chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don\&apos;t\n     ride! \n\nMuck: No! No! Quiet!\n\nTread: BMW\&apos;s are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion.\n     They even have luggage made by Sourkraut!\n\nHigh: My 9 too!\n\nTerrible, Heritick, Dill, Buck: Nahhhhh!!!\n\nStompin, Tread, High, Chunky, Snob: Yesss Yessssss!!!\n\nBefore this issue could be resolved the Hopalonga crew called up more\ncohorts from the local area including Polyanna Stirrup and the\ninfamous Booster Robiksen on his Cavortin! \n\nPolyanna: Well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like\n     I use on my Hopalonga Evening-Bird Special. Helpful for getting\n     it up on the ole ventral stand!  \n\nTerrible: Hopalonga\&apos;s are great like Polyanna says and Yuka-Yuka\&apos;s and\n     Sumarikis and Kersnapis are good too! \n\nBooster: I hate Cavortin.\n\nAll: WE KNOW, WE KNOW.\n\nBooster: I love Cavortin.\n\nAll: WE KNOW WE KNOW.\n\nMuck: Well, what about Mucho Guzlers and Lepurras?\n\nSnob, Tread: Nawwwwww.\n\nMuck: What about a Tridump?\n\nTerrible: Isn\&apos;t that a chewing gum?\n\nMuck: Auggggg, Waddda about a Pluck-a-kity?\n\nHeritick: Heyya Muck, you tryin\&apos; to call up the demon rider himself?\n\nMuck: No, no. There is more to Mudder-Disciples than arguing about make.\n\nTwo more riders zoom in, in the form of Pill Turret and Phalanx Lifter.\nPill: Out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever.\n\nPhalanx: Hey, I don\&apos;t know about that.\n\nAnd Now even more west coasters pour in.\nRoad O\&apos;Noblin: Hopalonga\&apos;s are the greatest!\n\nMaulled Beerstein: May you sit on a bikejector!\n\nSuddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth:\nKite Lanolin: Hey, BMW\&apos;s are great, men.\n\nRobo-Nickie: I prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally.\n\nMore riders from the west coast come into the discussion:\nAviator Sourgas: Get a Burley-Thumpison with a belted-rigged frame.\n\nGuess Gasket: Go with a BMW or Burley-Thumpison.\n\nWith a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. It\nwas none other that Clean Bikata on her Hopalonga CaBammerXorn. \nClean: Like look, Hopalonga are it but only CaBammerXorns. \n\nMuck: Why??\n\nClean: Well, like it\&apos;s gotta be a 6-banger or nothin.\n\nMuck: But I only have a 4-banger.\n\nClean: No GOOD!\n\nChunky: Sob, some of us only have 2-bangers!\n\nClean: Inferior!\n\nStompin: Hey, look, here\&apos;s proof BMW\&apos;s are better. The Bimmer-Boys\nburst into song: (singing) Beemer Babe, Beemer Babe give me a\nthrill... \n\nRoad, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Wadddoes BMW stand for? \n\nHeritick, Stompin, Snob, Chunky, Tread, Kite, High, Arlow: BEAT\&apos;S ME,\n     WILHEM! \n\nRoad, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Oh, don\&apos;t you mean BMW? \n\nAnd so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the\nthunder roared and the Greatest Mudder-Disciple (G.M.D.) of them all\nboomed out.\nG.M.D.: Enough of your bickering! You are doomed to riding\n     Bigot &amp; Suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions. \n\nAll: no, No, NO!!! Puhlease.\n\nDoes this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding\nmini-trikes?  Are our arguing heros doomed?  Tune in next week for the\nnext gut wretching episode of &quot;The Yearning and Riderless&quot; with its\never increasing cast of characters.  Where all technical problems will\nbe flamed over until well done.  Next week\&apos;s episode will answer the\nquestion of: &quot;To Helmet or Not to Helmet&quot; will be aired, this is heady\nmaterial and viewer discretion is advised. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Script for the Denizens of Doom Anthem Video\n\n                by Jonathan E. Quist   DoD #94\n\n\n[Scene:  A sterile engineering office.  A lone figure, whom we\&apos;ll call\nChuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white CDC lab coat,\nwith 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.] \n\n(editor\&apos;s note: For some reason a great deal of amusement was had at\nthe First Annual DoD Uni-Coastal Ironhorse Ride &amp; Joust by denizens\nreferring to each other as &quot;Chuck&quot;. I guess you had to be there. I\nwasn\&apos;t.) \n\nChuck:  I didn\&apos;t want to be a Software Systems Analyst,\n cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir,\n may-I-have-another-sir.  My mother made me do it.  I wanted\n to live a man\&apos;s life,\n[Music slowly builds in background]\n riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes\n and the deepest valleys,\n living the life of a Motorcyclist;\n doing donuts and evading the police;\n terrorizing old ladies and raping small children;\n eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).  In short,\n\n\tI Want to be      A Denizen!\n\n[Chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (with\nfringe), boots, and cap.  Scene simultaneously changes to the top of\nan obviously assaulted Rollins Pass.  A small throng of Hell\&apos;s Angels\nsit on their Harleys in the near background, gunning their engines,\nshowering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts, and leaking oil\non the tarmac.  Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed Fat\nBoy.] \n\nChuck [Sings to the tune of &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot;]:\n\nI\&apos;m a Denizen and I\&apos;m okay,\nI flame all night and I ride all day.\n\n[Hell\&apos;s Angels Echo Chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors]:\nHe\&apos;s a Denizen and he\&apos;s okay,\nHe flames all night and he rides all day.\n\nI ride my bike;\nI eat my lunch;\nI go to the lavat\&apos;ry.\nOn Wednesdays I ride Skyline,\nRunning children down with glee.\n\n[Chorus]:\nHe rides his bike;\nHe eats his lunch;\nHe goes to the lavat\&apos;ry.\nOn Wednesdays he rides Skyline,\nRunning children down with glee.\n\n[Chorus refrain]:\n\&apos;Cause He\&apos;s a Denizen...\n\nI ride real fast,\nMy name is Chuck,\nIt somehow seems to fit.\nI over-rate the worst bad f*ck,\nBut like a real good sh*t.\n\nOh, I\&apos;m a Denizen and I\&apos;m okay!\nI flame all night and I ride all day.\n\n[Chorus refrain]:\nOh, He\&apos;s a Denizen...\n\nI wear high heels\nAnd bright pink shorts,\n full leathers and a bra.\nI wish I rode a Harley,\n just like my dear mama.\n\n[Chorus refrain]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                    Why you have to be killed.\n\nWell, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed\nto read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the DoD started\nas a joke. And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.\n\nSometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: &quot;What does DoD\nstand for? It\&apos;s not the Department of Defense is it?&quot; Naturally, a\nDenizen who had watched the movie &quot;Top Gun&quot; a few times too many rose\nto the occasion and replied:\n\n&quot;That\&apos;s classified, we could tell you, but then we\&apos;d have to kill you.&quot;\n\nAnd the rest is history.\n\nA variation on the &quot;security&quot; theme is to supply disinformation about\nwhat DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where\nknown) include:\n\nDaughters of Democracy (DoD 23)\t\tDoers of Donuts\nDancers of Despair (DoD 9)\t\tDebasers of Daughters\nDickweeds of Denver\t\t\tDriveway of Death\nDebauchers of Donuts\t\t\tDumpers of Dirtbikes\n\nNote that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be\nlimited only by the contents of one\&apos;s imagination or dictionary file.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                     The rec.moto.photo archive\n\nFirst a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck\nRogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made,\nand several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in\nunknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate\nfor an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not\nonly provided the disk space and ftp &amp; e-mail access, but he has taken\nthe time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.\n\nNot only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk\nat their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the\nserver too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,\nthe general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.\n\nHere are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how\nto use the archive.\n\n**********************************************************\n\nVia ftp:\n\ncerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]\n\nVia e-mail:\n\nThe address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the\nmessage.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The\narguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For\nrec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:\n\ndir [dod]\nsend [dod]bruce_tanner.gif\nsend [dod]dodframe.ps\n\nand you\&apos;ll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts\nof bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.\n\nOh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to\nthe next whole file) are send.  A \&apos;send [dod]*.gif\&apos; would send 150 files of\n50K each; not a good idea.\n-- \nBruce Tanner        (213) 860-2451 x 596    Tanner@Cerritos.EDU\nCerritos College    Norwalk, CA             cerritos!tanner\n\n**********************************************************\n\nA couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so\nwhy not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?\nSecond, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind\nof you to access it after normal working hours (California time). \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                      Patches? What patches?\n\nYou may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &amp;\npins. And your reaction was probably: &quot;I want!&quot;, or &quot;That\&apos;s sick!&quot;, or\nperhaps &quot;That\&apos;s sick! I want!&quot;\n\nWell, there\&apos;s some good news and some bad news. The good news is that\nthere\&apos;s been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad\nnews is that there isn\&apos;t anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn\&apos;t\nbecause of any &quot;exclusivity&quot; attempt, but simply because there is no\n&quot;DoD store&quot; that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by\nindividual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is\nsomeone says &quot;I\&apos;m thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they\&apos;ll cost\n$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?&quot; Then\norders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the\npre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a\nDoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or\nproduce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all\nthis is anarchy in action.\n\nHere\&apos;s a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and\nperpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),\nmotorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts\n(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and\npatches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by\npopular demand].\n\nAll &quot;profits&quot; have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association\nMotorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been\ncontributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,\nyou\&apos;ll see a large plaque on the Founders\&apos; Wall in the name of &quot;Denizens\nof Doom, USENET, The World&quot;, complete with a DoD pin.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere\&apos;s a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.\n\n~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles\n~From: Arnie Skurow &lt;arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu&gt;\n~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum\n~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT\n\nI received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,\nthe other day.\n\n&quot;Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:\n\nCongratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the\nDenizens of Doom!  With your recent donation, the total amount donated is\nnow $5,500.  On behalf of the AMHF, please extend my heartfeld gratitude\nto all the membership of the Denizens.  The club\&apos;s new plaque is presently\nbeing prepared.  Of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to \nsee the plaque that will be installed in our Founders Foyer.  By the way,\nI will personally mount a Denizens club pin on the plaque.  Again, thank \nyou for all your support, which means so much to the foundation, the\nmuseum, and the fulfillment of its goals.\n\n                                Sincerely,\n\n\n                                Jim Rogers, D.O.D. #0395\n                                Director\n\nP.S.

Rides:\n\nSummer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third\nyear, and the Ride &amp; Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass\ntrip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got\ntogether for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north\nas NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of\nNorth Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great\nPacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for\nriding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have\ncome to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]\n\nAlso worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the\nMoab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up,\nriding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal\n2-strokes.  And though it\&apos;s not an &quot;official&quot; (as if anything could be\nofficial with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races\nin Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters\nto gather.  There\&apos;s also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah.\nEuropean Denizens have staged some gathers too.

It may go somewhat\n&gt; higher than that on the horizontal, but you won\&apos;t be happy with anything\n&gt; beyond 1024 x 768 on a 14&quot; 0.28 tube; you probably won\&apos;t be too thrilled\n&gt; with the 1024 x 768 on this tube, but it *will* sync up and display it.\n&gt; (I prefer at least a 16&quot; 0.28 for this resolution.)  Since SVGA is 800x600,\n&gt; it\&apos;ll do that too.  The horizontal range probably goes lower than 31.5, but\n&gt; I don\&apos;t know if it goes all the way down to straight NTSC-rate TV (which need\n&gt; about 15.75 kHz sweep).  As far as &quot;video compatibility&quot; (if I\&apos;m reading\n&gt; the question right: it won\&apos;t take anything but analog RGB inputs.

With this speed, you *truly* need sprites.\n[snip]\n(the 3DO is not a 68000!!!)\n&gt;|&gt; \n&gt;|&gt; Ricardo, the animation playback to which Lawrence was referring in an\n&gt;|&gt; earlier post is plain old Quicktime 1.5 with the Compact Video codec.\n&gt;|&gt; I&apos;ve seen digitized video (some of Apple&apos;s early commercials, to be\n&gt;|&gt; precise) running on a Centris 650 at about 30fps very nicely (16-bit\n&gt;|&gt; color depth). I would expect that using the same algorithm, a RISC\n&gt;|&gt; processor should be able to approach full-screen full-motion animation,\n&gt;|&gt; though as you&apos;ve implied, the processor will be taxed more with highly\n&gt;|&gt; dynamic material.\n[snip]\n&gt;booth there.  I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture\n&gt;using a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot\n&gt;quicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one\n&gt;(1.5).\n&gt;\n&gt;   They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite\n&gt;nicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by\n&gt;3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it\n&gt;wasn&apos;t 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he\n&gt;increased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10&lt;-&gt;12 fps. \n&gt;\n&gt;   Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don&apos;t know\n&gt;what model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime\n&gt;could play back at the same speed even on an LCII.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having\n&gt;a little bit of trouble.  And this wasn&apos;t even from the hardisk!  This was\n&gt;from memory!\n&gt;\n&gt;   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some\n&gt;hardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the \n&gt;animation (like supposedly MacroMind&apos;s Accelerator?)?\n&gt;\n&gt;   Don&apos;t misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.\n&gt;\n\n\nThe 3DO box is based on an ARM RISC processor, one or two custom graphics\nchips, a DSP, a double-speed CDROM, and 2MB of RAM/VRAM. (I&apos;m a little\nfuzzy on the breakdown of the graphics chips and RAM/VRAM capacity).\n\nIt was demonstrated at a recent gathering at the Electronic Cafe in\nSanta Monica, CA. From 3DO, RJ Mical (of Amiga/Lynx fame) and Hal\nJosephson (sp?) were there to talk about the machine and their plan. We\ngot to see the unit displaying full-screen movies using the CompactVideo codec\n(which was nice, very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws and Backdraft)\n... and a very high frame rate to boot (like 30fps).\n\nNote however that the 3DO&apos;s screen resolution is 320x240.\n\nCompactVideo is pretty amazing... I also wanted to point out that QuickTime\ndoes indeed slow down when one dynamically resizes material as was stated\nabove... I&apos;m sure if the material had been compressed at the large size\nthen it would play back fine (I have a Q950 and do this quite a bit). The\nprice of generality... personally I don&apos;t use the dynamic sizing of movies\noften, if ever. But playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quick\non the latest 040 machines.\n\nI&apos;m not sure how a Centris/20MHz 040 stacks up against the 25 MHz ARM in\nthe 3DO box.

A few points need to be clarified:\n\nThe Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or\nthe metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to\ncarry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the\nvoltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It\nshould never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the\nnormal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in\nthe power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding\nconductor.  \n\nMuch communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages\non the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding\nconductors to provide reliable operation  (&quot;orange&quot; outlets are often used for\nthis, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in\nmany cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read\nboth the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on\ninstalling quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated\ngrounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors\nback to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service\nentrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many\nof these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide\na safe ground or a quiet ground or either. \n\nThe GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is\nreferred to in the code as the &quot;identified&quot; conductor and is supposed to be\nwhite or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in\nmost electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance\npanel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household\nservice panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which\nattaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  \n\nThe Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In\nthe case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the\ncircuit from the panel to the load device.  \n\nSince the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding\nconductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance\nfrom the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but\nmeasurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,\nunder normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the\ngrounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of\nthe neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since\nthere will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also\nno longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment\nhas a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the &quot;U&quot;\nground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. \nThe difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few\ntenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not\npresent a shock hazard.  \n\nHOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact\nwith an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,\na metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to\nflow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you\nwill get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)\nUnder the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in\nsome cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of\ninadequate size, causing it to overheat.\n\nWith the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a\nshort circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may\nflow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which\nincreases the possibility for shock or fire.  \n\nAlso if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on\nthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often\ncausing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in\ntechnical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.\n\nThe Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as\nwell as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for\nlightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back\nto ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded\nobjects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses\nquickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the\ndwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it\nflows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause\ncorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,\nand it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop\nbetween the &quot;hot&quot; conductors in the service and the neutral current in the\nwater pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. \n(don\&apos;t flame ME on this, I\&apos;m just telling you where the field comes from, not\nit\&apos;s health effect, as far as I\&apos;m concerned, the jury is still out on this.)\n\nNote that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any\nsub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service\nentrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have\na seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this\napplication only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the\ngrounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding\nscrew, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above\nground, with the possible problems listed above.\n\nThe code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one\nbuilding to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be\nused as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate\nwire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. \nThese exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days\nbefore U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don\&apos;t want to\nhave to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don\&apos;t want to\nhave to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place\nof three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate\nneutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings\n(since most current is in the 220 volt &quot;hots&quot; except at some low settings, the\nwires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. \nSo far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,\nit\&apos;s primarily for lightning protection.\n\nPeople doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn\&apos;t a legal grounding\nconductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in &quot;romex&quot; \&apos;with ground\&apos; is.  Anywhere\nthere is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good\ngrounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes\nis a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under\nthe steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this\naluminum band off at the ends, you don\&apos;t have to bond it to anything, it does\nits job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall\ntubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding\nlocknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  \n\n&quot;Greenfield&quot; (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty\nsheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn\&apos;t have\nthe aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and\ninductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the\ngreenfield.\n\n&quot;Wiremold&quot; is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes\noften prevents good contact, and the &quot;feed&quot; to the wiremold extension is often\nfrom a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold\nbox.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and\nthe cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were &quot;hot&quot; with\n120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator\nhere in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one\nof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a\nground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in\nthe original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can &quot;bond&quot; the wire to the\nbox with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.\n\nOn another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets\nwhen ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them\nwithout a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the\nprotection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don\&apos;t\ninstall it.  The interrupter doesn\&apos;t depend on the ground to trip.  It is\ndesirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is\nconnected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,\nwhereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something\nprovides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded\nGCFI\&apos;s, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my \&apos;93\ncode is in the city, but I know the rule hasn\&apos;t changed.  It might be\nrenumbered though.) \n\nWe have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more\nto this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.  \n\nJohn\n-- \n*******************************************************************************\nJohn H.

As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases\nand hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output\nvoltage as possible. (about 260v).\n  The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages\n(ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v\nacross them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.\n  Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.\n If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will\nincrease the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem.\nThese capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of\nthem, So:\n\n1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel \nwith the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?\n  Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase\nthe RC time constant?

On a typical UPS (well, on ours, anyway),\n&gt;there is NO switchover from AC to DC.  All the protected equipment is\n&gt;ALWAYS running from the batteries (via an inverter), with the usual \n&gt;condition of also having them on charge.  If the power fails, big deal - \n&gt;the computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop, but \n&gt;there\&apos;s something like 60 car-sized batteries in that cabinet, so it \n&gt;takes a while).\n&gt;\n&gt;If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter,\n&gt;why not do it all the time?  Then there\&apos;d be no switchover to screw\n&gt;things up, and no having to sense the failure fast.  Just keep the DC\n&gt;on charge when the power is on, and it\&apos;ll be there in zero time when\n&gt;you &quot;need&quot; it.\n&gt;\n\nActually, it\&apos;s a bit more complicated than that...I sounds to me,\nyour UPS takes in AC, rectifies it to DC to charge the batteries, and\nthen takes the battery DC and chops it to AC again, feeding your\nequipment.  This approach is the easiest and cleanest way to\nswitchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since,\nas you mentioned, nothing will know about what happened down the line.\n\nAnother way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until you\nlose power, and then kick in the battery backup with it\&apos;s inverter to\nreplace the lost power.  The problem here is the switchover time and\nyou\&apos;ve got to resync the AC in no time flat.\n\nUnfortunately, most everything is built around the assumption that\nAC is available, so the UPS guys have to provide and AC output to\nbe usable...ya sorta have to make it work with what there already.\n\nSimilar story with our telephone system.  It was first invented back\nin the 1800\&apos;s.  We\&apos;re still using the same damn system (media) as they\ndid back then.

I\&apos;ve weathered attempted dog attacks before using the\napproved method: Slow down to screw up dog\&apos;s triangulation of target,\nthen take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it\ndidn\&apos;t work because I didn\&apos;t have time. Riding up the hill leading to my\nhouse, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to\nthe Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to\nthe Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to\nharm.\n\nBut I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the\nroughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph\nfor the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the\nleft side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he\nhad been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,\nheading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I\nsaw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took\nthe dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was\ndriven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent\nmarks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think\nI saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this\nmoment is hazy.\n\nI next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The\napologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut\nmouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my\nshin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.\nSo I\&apos;m left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!\n\nInterestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never\nmoved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike\noff course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some\ngut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me\nhere, as I didn\&apos;t feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.\n\nWhat worries me about the accident is this: I don\&apos;t think I could have\nprevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not\nnecessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was\nriding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if\nit had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the\nthought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a\nblind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are\nlong enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?\n\nI eagerly await comment.\n\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\nDoD# 0863      |I\&apos;d be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1a * &quot;He\&apos;s hurt.&quot; &quot;Dammit Jim, I\&apos;m a Doctor -- oh, right.&quot;\n                                                                                       \n----\n+===============================================================+\n|COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)|\n|Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|\n+===============================================================+\n&apos;, &quot;From: jlevine@rd.hydro.on.ca (Jody Levine)\nSubject: Re: Drinking and Riding (eww, gross)\nOrganization: Ontario Hydro - Research Division\nLines: 16\n\nIn article &lt;MJMUISE.38.733926270@1302.watstar.uwaterloo.ca&gt; MJMUISE@1302.watstar.uwaterloo.ca (Mike Muise) writes:\n&gt;\n&gt;1 hr/drink for the first 4 drinks.\n&gt;1.5 hours/drink for the next 6 drinks.\n&gt;2 hours/drink for the rest.\n\nIn my case it goes down after the first four, because the fifth one usually\nmakes me throw up the last two.\n\nNeedless to say, I don&apos;t drink very much anymore, as the last time that\nhappened was in the second year of my undergrad.

GANDLER) writes:\n&gt;\n&gt;\tHow does the radio Electronics free information cards work.\n&gt;Do they just send you some general information about the companies that\n&gt;advertise in their magazine or does it also give you sign you up for a\n&gt;catalog. \n\nThat depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled.\nRadio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser\ngets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers\nwho circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on\nself-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the\ndata on computer disk.\n\nThe advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will\nnotice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called\na &quot;bingo card&quot; in the industry) includes lines for a company name\nand a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national\nadvertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as\nbest they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company\nand include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably\nsend you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer\ncall you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they\nwill send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail\noutlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th\ne whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have\nnothing to mail out accept the catalog.\n\nA couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry\nmagazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They\nuse the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read\nthe magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push\nyou, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile\nhow many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.\nThis way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that &quot;23% of readers\nrequesting data were interested in capacitors.&quot; And finally, some\nmagazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For\nexample, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information\nabout test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC\&apos;s, in the past 6 months.\n\nThe other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines\ninclude how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the\nadvertiser can attempt to cull out the &quot;literature collectors&quot; from\nthe serious potential customers.\n\n&quot;Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.&quot;\n\nWhat\&apos;s the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?\n\n  Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more\n  than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of\n  weeks later.\n\n  If you are really, really serious and you really, really want\n  the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also\n  cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually\n  everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data\n  on a computer printout.\n\n  To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you\&apos;re\n  not really &quot;qualified&quot; for, send in a bingo card at least every\n  other month and circle two or three numbers.\n\n  Include a business name and phone number, even if it\&apos;s your house.\n  Advertisers almost never call. \n\nJohn Schuch\n  publisher of: The Arizona High-Tech Times\n                The Arizona Electrical Journal\n                The Arizona HVAC News\n  (all of which have bingo cards)\n\n\n&apos;, &apos;From: gerrit@laosinh.stgt.sub.org (Gerrit Heitsch)\nSubject: Re: 6551A and 6551 compatibility\nDistribution: world\nOrganization: Lao-Sinh project (private UUCP site)\nLines: 31\n\nIn article &lt;C5owvs.pr@world.std.com&gt;, Internet Surfer writes:\n\n&gt; Does any one know if the 6551 is timing/pin compatible with the 6551.. \n\nNo, the 6551A is able to operate in a 2 MHz system, the 6551 can only\ntake 1 MHz without problems.\n\nIf you see a 8551 made by MOS or CSG, take it, its a 6551A.\n\n&gt; It seems the 6551 has in iheirent bug with cts/rts handshaking and i need\n&gt; a suitable pin replacement to put in my serial card... possibly a buffered\n&gt; version perhaps?\n\nI know no fixed version of the 6551.

But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn&apos;t be too hard.\n\n&gt;1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as\n&gt;the circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)\n\n&gt;2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this center\n&gt;perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of\n&gt;the sphere.\n\n&gt;3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. This\n&gt;gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere&apos;s\n&gt;origin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.\n\n&gt;4) the radius is easy to compute, it&apos;s just the distance from the center to\n&gt;any of the original points.\n\n&gt;I&apos;ll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)\n\nGood I had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special case\nwith no solution that worried me.\n\nFour coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere \nthat they are on the surface of.\nSimilarly 4 colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the\nsurface of.\n\nThese algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design\nmeet these problems neatly.\n\nWhen determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are colinear\nthe algorithm should afil or return infinite R.\nWhen intersecting the two lines there are 2 possibilities\nthey are the same line  (the 4 points were on a planar circle)\nthey are different lines but parallel. There is a sphere of in radius.\n\nThis last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th point\nby taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be produced\n\nit can also be achieved by\n\nIf all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle. \n\nIt seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar.\nThe algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar.\n(4 points being colinear =&gt; coplanar)\n\nTesting if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 points\nhas been found is trivial.\n\n\n&gt;An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed\n&gt;by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the\n&gt;center of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersecting\n&gt;at a point.

Also, all the\n   &gt;touch sensitive lights in my house start going wacko, cycling through \n   &gt;their four brightness states.\n\n   &gt;I presume that some ham operator with an illegal amplifier drove past\n   &gt;my house (I live on a busy thoroughfare); would this be a correct presumption?\n   &gt;What kind of power must he be putting out to cause the effects?  \n   &gt;The affected equipment is about 100 feet from the road...\n\nHams are unlikely to have an illegal amp,  and are also unlikely to\nhave a &quot;dirty&quot; amp.\n\n   Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,\n   that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs\n\nNot possible either.  You\&apos;d need about a 300 amp alternator for\njust the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow\ndown on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.\n\n   for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt\n   radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet \n   away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.\n   If you experience the problem frequently, it may be \n   caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station\n   nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio \n   transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,\n   etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are\n   correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.\n\n   If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite\n   chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably\n   being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can\n   be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).\n   Good instructions are included with the chokes.\n   If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your\n   neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof\n   or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things\n   a radio operator can do to reduce interference.\n\nAnd please remember to be friendly when approaching your\nlocal radio operator.  This person may or may not be the \ncause of your troubles,  and you\&apos;ll get better cooperation\nand help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most\nare).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes\ndealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost\npictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b.\ninterferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.  \n\nBTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or\nnot he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of\nbeing a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it.\nToo bad they don\&apos;t require the consumer equipment makers\nto take any precautions.\n\nLast, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are\nrequired to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more\nthan 10).  So if you hear &quot;This is WA1QT&quot; or some other call starting\nwith A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham.\nCB\&apos;ers probably won\&apos;t sign (I don\&apos;t know that they\&apos;re even required\nto) and fire/police have other private ids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\nDouglas S.

Apparently land-based\n&gt;beacons tranmit GPS correction information to your GPS \n&gt;receiver (with differential option installed).\n\n&gt;How does this system work?  What frequency is used for\n&gt;the land-based beacons?\n\n&gt;Thanks in advance,\n\n&gt;Charlie Thompson\n&gt;.\n\nHere\&apos;s a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station\nwith a very exactly known position computes the errors in the\nincoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors\nincluding atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time\ndithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational \nequipment to &quot;back out&quot; the errors in its position (since it knows\nwhere it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a \nbroadcast which is available to any number of relatively local\nreceivers.  If the receivers are nearby (&lt;300km) and are using\nthe same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very\nsimilar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the\nreceiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference\nunit.\n\nThe US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series\nof coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will\nuse existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately\n305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals\non different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers\ncorrection signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system\nwhich has stations all across the US.\n\nThe correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format.\nAdvertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJohn P.

No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look \nvery clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All \nstill within factory specs. The only thing I could find, however, was a \nslightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem), \nbut it is still way below the wear-limit given in the Clymer-manual for \nthis bike. \nAny syggestions??? What else could cause my problem??? Do I have to hone \nthe cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in \norder to get better breaking in of my new rings??? Won&apos;t that increase the \nwear of my pistons??\nPlease send comments to \n\tsruhl@mechanical.watstar.uwaterloo.ca\nThanks in advance.

Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :\n  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll\n  house supplies.\n  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don\&apos;t have\n  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.\n\nBooks with textures:\n--------------------\n  Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.\n  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also\n  a wide variety of stock art is available.\n  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,\n  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.\n\n  In Italy, there\&apos;s a company called Belvedere that makes such books\n  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your\n  graphics work. Their address is:\n\tEdition Belvedere Co. Ltd.,\n\t00196 Rome Italy,\n\tPiazzale Flaminio, 19\n\tTel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60\n\nTexture Libraries:\n------------------\na. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit\n   textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit\n   TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume\n   (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.\n\n   Contact:\n   Mannikin Sceptre Graphics\n   1600 Indiana Ave.\n   Winter Park, FL 32789\n   Phone: (407) 384-9484\n   FAX: (407) 647-7242\n\nb. ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine\n   by Impulse, Inc.

Introduction to rendering algorithms\n========================================\n\na. Ray-Tracing:\n---------------\n\n  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read\n  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would\n  suggest:\n   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press\n     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4\n  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can\&apos;t be wrong\n  using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines\n  (erich@eye.com)\n\nThere\&apos;s a more concise reference also:\n\n  Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: &quot;An Introduction to Ray Tracing&quot;, in\n  &quot;Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD&quot;, ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,\n  NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.\n\nIt contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.\n\nb. Z-buffer (depth-buffer)\n--------------------------\n\nA good reference is:\n\n        _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F.

Teapot ?\n-----------\n\n&quot;Displays on Display&quot; column of IEEE CG&amp;A Jan \&apos;87 has the whole\nstory about origin of the Martin Newell\&apos;s teapot. The article also has\nthe bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe\nmodel of the teapot.\n\nIEEE CG&amp;A Sep \&apos;87 in Jim Blinn\&apos;s column &quot;Jim Blinn\&apos;s Corner&quot; describes\nan another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for\nexample are used.\n\nThe OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you\&apos;re advised to get\nthem to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at\na specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).\nThe SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a\ntessellation at any specified resolution.\n\nb. Space Shuttle ?\n------------------\n\nTolis Lerios &lt;tolis@nova.stanford.edu&gt; has built a list of Space Shuttle\ndatafiles. Here\&apos;s a summary (From his sci.space list):\n\nmodel1:\nA modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)\n\n406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)\n389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).\nPayload doors non-existent.\nUnits: unknown.\n\nSimon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He\nsaid there is no proprietary information associated with it.\n\nmodel2:\nThe newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in\n\ngondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo\nhanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data\n\nmodel3:\nThe triangles\&apos; model.\n\nThis model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.\n\nGreg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did\nnot mention any restriction on the model\&apos;s distribution.\n\nmodel4:\nThe NASA model.\n\nThe file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers,\ndefining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:\n\n&lt;x offset&gt; &lt;y offset&gt; &lt;z offset&gt;\n\nFrom then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions\n\n3473 vertices.\n2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,\n 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,\n 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex).\nPayload doors closed.\nUnits: inches.\n\nJon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model\nProprietary info: unknown\n\nmodel5:\nThe old shuttle model.\n\nThe file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.\n\n104 vertices.\n452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex).\nPayload doors open.\nUnits: meters.\n\nWe have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for\nsome years now.

Image annotation software\n=============================\n\na. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in\n  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn\&apos;t normally stored\n  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a\n  rasterfile.\n\nb. Idraw (part of Stanford\&apos;s InterViews distribution) can handle some\n  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I\&apos;m not\n  sure exactly what they are.\n  You can ftp the idraw\&apos;s binary from interviews.stanford.edu.\n\nc. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\n  Tgif\&apos;s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\n\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\n\ne. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output\n  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.\n\nf. \&apos;ice\&apos; requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It\&apos;s a PostScript-based\n  graphical editor,and it\&apos;s available for anonymous ftp from Internet host\n  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and\n  two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based\n  toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,\n  pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed\n  tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation\n  instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).\n  A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for\n  SPARC systems is also available for ftp.\n\n  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not\n  be redistributed without permission.\n\n  ice means Image Composition Environment and it\&apos;s an imaging tool that\n  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of\n  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging\n  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.\n\ng. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the \n  position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen \n  color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many\n  of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as\n  export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest\n  X11 archive.\n\n========================================================================\n\n17.

This was\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\&apos;s a few thousand dollars (American) I\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\n  purpose packages I\&apos;ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\&apos;m not sure how general purpose\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\&apos;ve\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\&apos;s a\n  freebie if you want it&quot;\n\n  &quot;My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\n  Excel on the Mac if it\&apos;s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\n  that combination couldn\&apos;t handle, and the speed and ease of use\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\&apos;s mostly astronomical\n  image processing which I\&apos;ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) &quot;\n\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets \n  comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars, \n  menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability \n  of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an \n  encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap \n  manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted\n  to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only \n  color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets \n  developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget \n  set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers \n  using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other \n  Motif widgets.\n\n  FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) \n  simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these\n  simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these\n  data graphically. \n  FVS accepts three-dimensional multi-block data recorded in NCSA HDF format.\n\n iti.gov.sg [192.122.132.130] : /pub/svlib (Scientific Visualization)\n      /pu/fvs; These directories contain demo binaries for Sun4/SGI\n\n  Cost : US$200 for academic and US$300 for non-academic institutions.\n  (For each of the above items).

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\n===================================================\n\nGRASS\n-----\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\n  capabilities.\n\n  Feature Descriptions\n\n  I use GRASS  because it\&apos;s public domain and can be obtained through the\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.&quot; A first review  of\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\n\n  Availability\n\n  CERL\&apos;s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\n\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  This location will be the new &quot;canonical&quot; source for GRASS software, as\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\n  &quot;tar&quot; archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\n  Parks\&apos; GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\n  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\n\n  Support\n\n  Listserv mailing lists:\n\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\n  Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the\n  community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,\n  we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass\n  through the list.

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\n\n  Feature Description\n\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\n\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\n  for GIS applications.\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\n\nPCI\n---\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different &quot;industry standard&quot;\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\n\n  The &quot;PCI software&quot; consists of several classes/groups/packages of\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common &quot;PCI\n  database&quot; disk file.  The &quot;Tape I/O&quot; package is a set of utility\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the &quot;PCI database&quot; file;\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\n  &quot;multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5&quot;), and\n  God only knows what all else -- there\&apos;s a LOT.  I don\&apos;t have and don\&apos;t\n  use these, so can\&apos;t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\n  particular application/interest calls for.\n\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight &quot;parameters,&quot; read from\n  a common &quot;parameter file&quot; which must be (in VMS anyway) in your &quot;default\n  directory.&quot;  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\&apos;s\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\n\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\n  Macintosh calls &quot;raw&quot;) data from tape, in a number of different\n  &quot;interleave&quot; orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\n  graphic-arts industry\&apos;s &quot;CT2T&quot; format, would probably (I haven\&apos;t tried)\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\n  YOU\&apos;RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\n  over.  It\&apos;s worth noting that the PCI &quot;database&quot; file is designed to\n  contain not only &quot;raster&quot; (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\n  can go into the PCI &quot;database&quot;).\n\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\n  display directly from a PCI &quot;database&quot; file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be &quot;overkill&quot;\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very &quot;high end&quot;\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\&apos;t suffice\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\&apos;s\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\n  areas.\n\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\n--------------------------------\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, &lt;= 256 pixels\n  across by &lt;= 512 lines by &lt;= 256 bands); a modified version has since\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\n\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\n\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\&apos;re interested.  PCW requires X\n  for display.\n\nMAP II\n------\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\n\nCLRview\n-------\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\n\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

Features\n===========\n\nDMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:\n\n\n - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard\n   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)\n\n - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display\n\n - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)\n\n - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale\n\n - color-space selection\n\n - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required\n\n - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)\n\n - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for\n   VGA and many Super-VGAs\n\n...\n\n4. Technical information\n========================\n\nThe player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\nThe IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\n(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\ncoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\n(sounds great, doesn&apos;t it?), which turned out to be faster than a &apos;fast&apos;\nalgorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\ndifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\nalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\nuse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\ndominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\nthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\n\nRestricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\n+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\nover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\nis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\nexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\n\nSaturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\nsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\nby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\nconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\nlower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\nto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\non NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish\nareas.\n\n...\n\n--\nStefan Eckart, stefan@lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de\n&quot;, &apos;From: mcole@spock (COLE)\nSubject: 8051 Microcontroller\nOrganization: New Mexico State University\nLines: 3\nNNTP-Posting-Host: spock.nmsu.edu\n\nI would like to experiment with the INTEL 8051 family.

The Mouth of the South.\nLines: 99\n\nnagle@netcom.com (John Nagle) writes:\n\n&gt;&gt;Great Explaination, however you left off one detail, why do you always\n&gt;&gt;see them at nuclear plants, but not always at fossil fuel plants.  At\n&gt;&gt;nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle, whereas\n&gt;&gt;fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot\n&gt;&gt;water.  As I recall the water isn\&apos;t as hot (thermodynamically) in many\n&gt;&gt;fossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactive\n&gt;&gt;contamination.\n\nActually the reasons you don\&apos;t see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are\n1) fossil units (multiple units per plant) are generally smaller than\nnuclear plants.  300 MWe seemed to be a very popular size when many\nfossil plants were built.  The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many\nfossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were\nadopted (&quot;why those old dirt burners can\&apos;t harm anything, let \&apos;em go.&quot;).  \n3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally\nnot visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil\nplants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.\n\n&gt;       Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual \n&gt;boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.  (There\&apos;s a gripe in the industry\n&gt;that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it\&apos;s\n&gt;more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system\n&gt;as cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.  \n\n&gt;       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they\n&gt;usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the\n&gt;way down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,\n&gt;rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about &quot;thermal \n&gt;pollution&quot; de-icing a river, said, &quot;Up here, we view heat as a resource&quot;.  \n\nActually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants\nof similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the \nheat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in\norder to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is\nnormally water\&apos;s vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is\ndesirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because \nmoisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine \nlow pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity\ncauses erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest\npressure condensing environment is always the best.  \n\nA related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where\nthe water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the\ncondenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the \ncondensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too \nhot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into\nsteam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a\nparticularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all\ncosts.  \n\nThe hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant\nin order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower \nthey must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in\nthe hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 \ndegrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is\nused to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower\nsystem is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water\nis pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,\noperators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order \nto provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher\nhotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the\ncondenser area.\n\nAt least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the\nair :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge\nwater from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water\nfrom the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and\nhumidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water\ntemperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical\n&quot;95-95&quot; days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East.\nIt is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful\nin clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the\nplant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets\ntoo high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive\npressure.\n\n&gt;       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is \n&gt;purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when\n&gt;the water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than \n&gt;cooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.\n\nTrue.  Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity and\nfeeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard \nstepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves.\nThe plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood\nthe costs of impure water.  By &quot;impure&quot;, I mean water with a few\ndozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolved\noxygen.  Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will \nfind outside the laboratory.\n\nJohn\n-- \nJohn De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?  \nPerformance Engineering Magazine(TM) | Interested in high tech and computers? \nMarietta, Ga                         | Send ur snail-mail address to \njgd@dixie.com                        | perform@dixie.com for a free sample mag\nLee Harvey Oswald: Where are ya when we need ya?\n&apos;, &apos;From: CGKarras@world.std.com (Christopher G Karras)\nSubject: Need Maintenance tips\nOrganization: The World Public Access UNIX, Brookline, MA\nLines: 29\n\n\nAfter reading the service manual for my bike (Suzuki GS500E--1990) I have\na couple of questions I hope you can answer:\n\nWhen checking the oil level with the dip stick built into the oil fill\ncap, does one check it with the cap screwed in or not?

The electronics and dynamics of the ink\n&gt; cartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch.\n&gt; On almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.\n&gt; \n&gt; The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer\n&gt; results in much less spread than ink drop technology.\n\nIn practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed \nwith inkjet because smudges etc. can happen.\n\n&gt; It doesn\&apos;t take much investigation to see that the mechanical and\n&gt; electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than\n&gt; inexpensive ink jet printers.  Recall also that laser printers\n&gt; offer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1\n&gt; ppm for an ink jet printer.\n\nA cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of \nthat how long does the _first_ sheet take to print? Inkjets are faster than \nyou say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the \nprinter. (I have a 486/33 and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the \nprinter)\n\nA sage said to me: &quot;Do you want one copy or lots of copies?&quot;, &quot;One&quot;, \n&quot;Inkjet&quot;.\n \n&gt; Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the\n&gt; life of the printer.  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about\n&gt; $US 75-80 at discount while HP high capacity (~500-1000 page yield)\n&gt; cartridges are about $US 22 at discount.  It could be that over the\n&gt; life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are\n&gt; less than ink jet printers.  It is getting progressively closer\n&gt; between the two technologies.  Laser printers are usually desinged\n&gt; for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product\n&gt; replacement cycles.\n\nPaper cost is the same and both can use refills. Long term the laserprinter \nwill need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that \nare the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.\n\nHP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the \nsoftware package has no inkjet driver. \n\nThere is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a \npage printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer. This means that a \nlaserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot. Few drivers \nactually use this facility.\n(there is also the matter of downloadable fonts and so on)\n\n  TC. \n    E-mail: tchannon@black.demon.co.uk or tchannon@cix.compulink.co.uk\n                                \n&apos;, &quot;From: Wayne Alan Martin &lt;wm1h+@andrew.cmu.edu&gt;\nSubject: Re: Help with ultra-long timing\nOrganization: Senior, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA\nLines: 7\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: po4.andrew.cmu.edu\nIn-Reply-To: &lt;1pqk9b$ib4@sunb.ocs.mq.edu.au&gt;\n\nSounds like a job for a universal time reciever.

It seems to me that I&apos;d have the\n&gt;&gt; same electrical circuit if I hooked the jumper from the neutral\n&gt;&gt; over to the ground screw on new &apos;three prong&apos; grounding outlets.\n&gt;&gt; What&apos;s wrong with my reasoning here?  \n&gt;\n&gt;What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is \n&gt;to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact,\n&gt;depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.\n\nYou still need to supply a proper ground for a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter!\nSo rewiring is still a part of this job, however, the ground may be connected to\na local earth ground, rather than back at the breaker box.\n\nAs Jamie said, GFCI devices are required by code in a number of places, most\nnotably: bathrooms, and outside the house.  I do suggest the use of GFCI outlets,\nrather than the breakers.  You will end up with much less headaches.  Noise pickup\nin long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the breakers.\n\nGFCI devices do save lives, if you decide to install them, be sure to check them\nregularly (using the test button).\n\nRunning the family business (electrical supplies and lighting) for many years, I\nhave seen too many seasoned electricians fried, because they forgot to double check\ntheir common sense list.

The Mouth of the South.\nKeywords: Nuclear\nLines: 33\n\nswalker@uts.EDU.AU (-s87271077-s.walker-man-50-) writes:\n\n&gt;I was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that\n&gt;are ever present at nuclear poer sites. They look like cylinders\n&gt;that have been pinched in the middle. Does anybody know what the\n&gt;actual purpose of those things are?. I hear that they&apos;re called\n&gt;&apos;Cooling Towers&apos; but what the heck do they cool?\n&gt;I hope someone can help \n\n\nThe actual hourglass is hollow and is designed to generate a draft,\nexploiting the venturi effect.  Around the base of the hourglass is a\nring of water towers.  Warm river water, coming from the steam condenser\nin the plant, is sprayed over louvres.  The draft being pulled through\nthe tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection.  The\nsensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for\ndraft generation.\n\nIt should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used on\nboth fossile and nuclear plants.  It should also be noted that at \nlocations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used part\ntime, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit.\nIt was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish.\nFishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  Nontheless, stringent,\nusually state, regulations remain in some instances.  Since it typically\ntakes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed \nto cool a 1000 MWe plant, the cost of using the towers is not insignificant.\n-- \nJohn De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?  \nPerformance Engineering Magazine(TM) | Interested in high tech and computers? \nMarietta, Ga                         | Send ur snail-mail address to \njgd@dixie.com                        | perform@dixie.com for a free sample mag\nLee Harvey Oswald: Where are ya when we need ya?\n&quot;, &quot;From: massey@travis.llnl.gov\nSubject: Re: Jacob&apos;s Ladder\nArticle-I.D.: travis.1993Apr6.093828.1\nOrganization: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\nLines: 15\nNNTP-Posting-Host: travis.llnl.gov\n\nIn article &lt;C4z6x7.16B@murdoch.acc.Virginia.EDU&gt;, dgj2y@kelvin.seas.Virginia.EDU (David Glen Jacobowitz) writes:\n&gt; \tI&apos;ve been wanting to build a Tesla coil for quite awhile now (\n&gt; who doesn&apos;t, right? ) and I thought it would be a good intermidiate\n&gt; step to build a JAcob&apos;s Ladder first.\n&gt; \tWell, I have been looking for a high voltage transformer that\n&gt; is reasonable inexpensive ( neon sign transformers cost mucho ).\n\n\nIn the past I&apos;ve managed to buy used neon sign transformers from sign shops \nfor about $20.

Hence, any apparent\n&gt;similarity in handling characteristics may, or may *not* be analagous\n&gt;in its underlying physics to that behind motorcycle handling\n&gt;characteristics.\n\nOK, as one last attempt, I\&apos;ll take a different tack.\n\nWe all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why\none can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,\nis one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to\ndesign an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and\nsee which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of\nus who have bikes are familiar.\n\nLet\&apos;s look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its\nown, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to\nget rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches\nto transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to\nremain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,\nthrough suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the\nsame way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along \na dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change \nsurfaces to something that won\&apos;t transmit forces through the contact \npatches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It \nprobably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, \nbut we wouldn\&apos;t get a good idea of how well or what it feels like \nbecause, without the contact patches, we can\&apos;t turn.  Maybe there\&apos;s a \nbetter way. Besides, even ice doesn\&apos;t get rid of the contact patch\nforces altogether, so we\&apos;d have to find a really frictionless surface.\nYou\&apos;d have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it\nwas the rotation that did it.\n\nLooking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.\nNow we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and\ndirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them\nabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.\nHow it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we\&apos;re just looking\nfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and not\nsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don\&apos;t know of any snow-ski\nor skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged\nlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.\nI think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like\nthat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.\nNow I admit that this is second hand info (although I\&apos;d love to try\none of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in\na bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very\nmuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.\nSo we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike\&apos;s,\na similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have\ncountersteering.\n\nConclusion: you don\&apos;t need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have\nmotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don\&apos;t know what\nreal effect the gyroscopes have when they\&apos;re there, but from my observations\nof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I\&apos;m \nwilling to bet that they\&apos;re not the dominant factor in countersteering. \n\nIf you don\&apos;t like this conclusion, then don\&apos;t accept it, but my motorcycle\&apos;s\nbehaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.\n\nI\&apos;ve        bike                      like       | Jody Levine  DoD #275 kV\n     got a       you can        if you      -PF  | Jody.P.Levine@hydro.on.ca\n                         ride it                 | Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n&apos;, &quot;From: morley@suncad.camosun.bc.ca (Mark Morley)\nSubject: Medical Images via Gopher?\nNntp-Posting-Host: suncad.camosun.bc.ca\nOrganization: Camosun College, Victoria B.C, Canada\nX-Newsreader: Tin 1.1 PL4\nLines: 11\n\nA few days back someone posted info on a gopher site where you could\nsearch for medical graphics, etc.  Could someone please repost or mail me\na copy?

Places to find the Resource Listing\n======================================\n\n#This file is crossposted to comp.graphics, comp.answers and news.answers,\nso if you can\&apos;t locate it in comp.graphics, you\&apos;re advised to search in\n#comp.answers or news.answers\n(The latter groups usually are archived in your site. Contact your sysadmin\nfor more info).\n\nThese 3 articles are posted to comp.graphics 3-4 times a month and are kept in\nmany places (see below)\n\n--\n\nMany FAQs, including this one, are available on the archive site\npit-manager.mit.edu (alias rtfm.mit.edu) [18.172.1.27] in the directory\npub/usenet/news.answers.  The name under which a FAQ is archived appears\nin the Archive-name line at the top of the article.\nThis FAQ is archived as graphics/resources-list/part[1-3]\n\nThere\&apos;s a mail server on that machine. You send a e-mail message to\nmail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu  containing: help in the Subject: field\n\n--\n\nThe inria-graphlib mail server mirrors this posting (see under the\nSubject 4: Mail servers )\n\n--\n\nThe Resource Listing is accesible through WAIS in the machine\nenuxva.eas.asu.edu (port 8000) under the name graphics-resources-list.\nIt\&apos;s got a digest-type line before every numbered item for purposes of\nindexing.\n\n--\n\nAnother place that monitors the Listing is the MaasInfo files.\nFor more info contact Robert E. Maas &lt;rem@btr.com&gt;\n\n--\n\nYet another place to search for FAQs in general is the SWITCH\n(Swiss Academic and Research Network) system in Switzerland:\n\ninteractive:\n  telnet nic.switch.ch [130.59.1.40], login as &quot;info&quot;. Move to the\n  info_service/Usenet/periodic-postings directory. Search in the\n  00index file by typing &quot;/&quot; and the word to look for.\n  You may then just read the FAQ in the &quot;faqs&quot; directory, or decide\n  to fetch it by one of the following methods.\n\nftp:\n  login to nic.switch.ch [130.59.1.40] as user anonymous and\n  enter your internet-style address after being prompted for a\n  password.\n\n\tcd info_service/Usenet/periodic-postings\n\nmail:\n  send e-mail to\n\nRFC-822:\n   archive-server@nic.switch.ch\nX.400:\n  /S=archive-server/OU=nic/O=switch/PRMD=switch/ADMD=arcom/C=ch/\n\nEnter \&apos;help\&apos; in the bodypart to receive instructions. No information\nis required in the subject header line.\n\n\n1. ARCHIE\n=========\n\nThe Archie is a service system to locate FTP places for\nrequested files. It\&apos;s appreciated that you will use Archie\nbefore asking help in the newsgroups.\n\nArchie servers:\n  archie.au or 139.130.4.6             (Aussie/NZ)\n  archie.funet.fi or 128.214.6.100  (Finland/Eur.)\n  archie.th-darmstadt.de or 130.83.128.111  (GER.)\n  cs.huji.ac.il or 132.65.6.5             (Israel)\n  archie.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp or 130.54.20.1 (JAPAN)\n  archie.sogang.ac.kr or 163.239.1.11      (Korea)\n  archie.ncu.edu.tw or telnet 140.115.19.24  (TWN)\n  archie.doc.ic.ac.uk or 146.169.3.7  (UK/Ireland)\n  archie.sura.net or 128.167.254.179    (USA [MD])\n  archie.unl.edu (password: archie1)    (USA [NE])\n  archie.ans.net or 147.225.1.2         (USA [NY])\n  archie.rutgers.edu or 128.6.18.15     (USA [NJ])\n  archie.nz or 130.195.9.4           (New Zealand)\n\nConnect to Archie server with telnet and type &quot;archie&quot; as username.\nTo get help type \&apos;help\&apos;.\nYou can get \&apos;xarchie\&apos; or \&apos;archie\&apos;, which are clients that call Archie\nwithout the burden of a telnet session.\n\&apos;Xarchie\&apos; is on the X11.R5 contrib tape, and \&apos;archie\&apos; on comp.sources.misc,\nvol. 27.\n\nTo get information on how to use Archie via e-mail, send mail with\nsubject &quot;help&quot; to &quot;archie&quot; account at any of above sites.\n\n(Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is\naccessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000].\nConnect to it and specify &quot;archie&quot; as the host name and &quot;archie&quot; as\nthe username.)\n\n==========================================================================\n\n2. Notes\n========\n(Excerpted from the FAQ article)\n\nPlease do *not* post or mail messages saying &quot;I can\&apos;t FTP, could\nsomeone mail this to me?&quot;  There are a number of automated mail servers\nthat will send you things like this in response to a message.\n\nThere are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups\nand make them available via an email query system.  You send a message\nto an automated server saying something like &quot;send comp.sources.unix/fbm&quot;,\nand a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.\n\n==========================================================================\n\n3.

One\nguy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well,\nI saw one think that someone said about &quot;Show me a team that used Split-\nfires....&quot;  Well, here\&apos;s some additional insight and some theories\nabout splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.\n\nSplitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and\nincreased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires\nincreased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren\&apos;t focusing\non horsepower numbers.\n\nNow how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that\ndepends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine?\nIn the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque,\nbut 4\&apos;s make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low.\nSo for 4\&apos;s, splitfires would not significantly increase power.\n\nBut what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins,\nbut many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for\nthe hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However,\ntwins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this\ntranslate?  Increased torque should &quot;theoretically&quot; help twins make\nmore power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods\nor anything made, just stick \&apos;em in.\n\nNow I don\&apos;t know about all of this (and I\&apos;m trying to catch up with\nsomebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than\n4\&apos;s.        \n\nAs far as racing teams....  Ducati team &quot;Fast by Ferraci&quot; used\nsplitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James\nrunning for em), but I don\&apos;t know why they stopped since then.\nAlso, somebody check to see if they had them in 88.....\n\nPeace.\n\nWarren\nwcd82671@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n&quot;Have Suzuki, will travel...&quot;\n\nAt a local &quot;fix-er-up-er&quot; shop, the bike repairest looked at a\ndumped ZX-7.

The 2600 had some extra ASIC chips that were basically\nmodified graphics chips and PIA\&apos;s for the joysticks. Later model 2600\nmight have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI, as the weight\nof the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years.\n\nAdditionally, I think the 2600 used 2K, 4K, and up to 8K of ROM for\ntheir games. I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with, but I\nwould hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM. Think comes from a lot of hacking\nwith the 800 and 130xe computers. And occasionally hacking with the\n2600 (fixing it for monitor composite video use, and audio hookups).\nAlso I tryed to make a cartridge-less system that stored the ROM into\na RAM cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time (a way to\nbackup cartridges). I\&apos;ve heard of a setup like this where games could\nbe bought (cheaply) on FSK-recorded tapes, then you would load them\ninto a special RAM cartidge, and play them.\n\nAnyways, if you\&apos;re interested in looking for 2600 equipment, we\&apos;ve got\ntwo 2600 machines around (one composite A/V modified), and lotsa\ncartridges. Willing to sell for reasonable offer + shipping and\nhandling. Don\&apos;t play it anymore, since going to computers + Nintendo\n(interested in that too?).\n\nHope that helps your question...

It works great, but requires frequent \n&gt; rotation for those distant stations.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Brad Beer,  4414 Castle Gate Drive,  Beavercreek, OH  45432-1814\n\nBrad,\n   For an antenna, gain is synonymous with directionality.  The only way \nto get gain (&gt;1) out of an antenna is to design in directionality. The \n&quot;gain&quot; of an antenna is defined as the signal increase (for a preferred \ndirection) over the signal obtained by an isotropic antenna.\n\nBob Sciamanda\nEdinboro Univ of PA\n&apos;, &quot;From: rbn@apple.com (Robert B.

Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\n&gt;air into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\n&gt;valve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\n&gt;the difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\n&gt;the exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\n&gt;intake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\n&gt;atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\n&gt;does the pressure ever become &quot;negative&quot;, or even approach a good\n&gt;vacuum.\n\nThere are a number of other factors that are very important, the three\nbiggest being air velocity, air momentum and shock waves.\nVelocity stacks have been used for years and are now being used inside\nof stock airboxes on a number of bikes.  At a tuned engine rpm, the\nstacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the air\nrushing in.\nAir momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum of\nthe air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside\nlong after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke.\nShock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from\nescaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansion\nchambers or any other means of presenting a \&apos;wall\&apos; (opening or closing)\nto the air in motion.  Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how they\ndesign for shock waves.\n\n\t&lt;================================================&gt;\n       /        Rich Sturges           (h) 703-536-4443   \\\n      /    NSWC - Carderock Division   (w) 301-227-1670    \\\n     /  &quot;I speak for no one else, and listen to the same.&quot;  \\\n    &lt;========================================================&gt;\n&apos;, &apos;From: ray@unisql.UUCP (Ray Shea)\nSubject: Re: What is it with Cats and Dogs ???!\nOrganization: UniSQL, Inc., Austin, Texas, USA\nLines: 17\n\nIn article &lt;1993Apr14.200933.15362@cbnewsj.cb.att.com&gt; jimbes@cbnewsj.cb.att.com (james.bessette) writes:\n&gt;In article &lt;6130328@hplsla.hp.com&gt; kens@hplsla.hp.com (Ken Snyder) writes:\n&gt;&gt;ps.

This\n       provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal\n       and vertical directions.\n       The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256.\n       Video signal capture time - 2.5s.\n\n                     CONTROLLER VS52\n\n       The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM\n       PC AT or any other machine of that type. The controller was\n       created on the base of modern elements, including user\n       programmable gate arrays.\n       The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different\n       resolutions. Its flexible architecture makes possible to change\n       technical parameters. Instead of TV signal one can process any\n       other analog signal (including signals from slow-speed scanning\n       devices).\n       The controller has the following technical characteristics:\n       - memory volume - from 256 K to 2 Mb ;\n       - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64\n       to 1024x512 pixels ;\n       - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024\n       pixels;\n       - video signal capture time - 40 ms.\n       - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024\n       pixels ;\n       - number of gray level - 256 ;\n       - clock rate for input - up to 30 MHz ;\n       - 4 input video multiplexer ;\n       - input/output lookup table (LUT);\n       - possibility to realize &quot;scroll&quot; and &quot;zoom&quot;;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       - 8 lines for external synchronization (an input using external\n       controlling signal) ;\n       - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog -\n       digital converter;\n       - possibility output image to the color RGB monitor.\n       One can change all listed above functions and parameters of the\n       controller by reprogramming it.\n\n\n              IMAGE PROCESSOR VS100\n\n\n            Image processor VS100 allows to digitize and process TV\n       signal in real time. It is possible digitize TV signal with\n       512*512*8 resolution and realize arithmetic and logic operation\n       with two images.\n            Processor was created on the base of modern elements\n       including user programmable gate arrays and designed as a board\n       for PC.\n            Memory volume allows write to the 256 frames with 512*512*8\n       format. It is possible to accumulate until 16 images.\n            The processor has the following technical characteristics:\n       - memory volume to 64 Mb;\n       - number of the gray level - 256;\n       - 4 input video multiplexer;\n       - input/output lookup table;\n       - electronic adjustment for black and white ADC reference;\n       - image size from 256*256 to 8192*8192;\n       - possibility color and black / white output;\n       - possibility input from slow-scan video sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&apos;, &apos;From: mbc@po.CWRU.Edu (Michael B.

This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important\n&gt; -- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the\n&gt; road, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up\n&gt; newspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will\n&gt; hurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is\n&gt; that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The\n&gt; larger the dog, the greater your anger.\n\nThis tactic depends for its effectiveness on the dog\&apos;s conformance to\na &quot;psychological norm&quot; that may not actually apply to a particular dog.\nI\&apos;ve tried it with some success before, but it won\&apos;t work on a Charlie Manson\ndog or one that\&apos;s really, *really* stupid.  A large Irish Setter taught me\nthis in *my* yard (apparently HIS territory) one day.  I\&apos;m sure he was playing \na game with me.

Now while I think\n&gt;I understand what oversampling is (the rate of discrete &quot;samples&quot;\n&gt;exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor),\n&gt;I don\&apos;t understand this &quot;8 TIMES&quot; business...  It seems to me that when\n&gt;I bought my first CD player (was it REALLY 10 years ago?!), the specs\n&gt;said &quot;4 TIMES&quot; ...  Could someone please tell me whether I\&apos;m getting\n&gt;senile?  If I\&apos;m not, then what good does it do for the player to take\n&gt;samples at a higher rate?  If I really wanted better fidelity, wouldn\&apos;t\n&gt;I have to have the same higher rate of sampling during the recording\n&gt;process?  Furthermore, am I wrong in interpreting the sampling rate\n&gt;(from the player\&apos;s point of view) as being the same thing as the data\n&gt;rate for the bit stream coming off the optical medium?  Does this mean\n&gt;that the data rate (related to the rotational speed of the disk) has \n&gt;changed since 1983?\n\n[Note: I just tried to figure this stuff out about a month ago myself, from\nvarious people on the net, so I could be wrong.]\n\nThe data is only ever read once (barring mistracks and such, of course),\nand eventually gets turned into 44.1 KHz, 16 bit, two channel data.\nOversampling takes two discrete data points, and interpolates n-1 points\nbetween them for n times oversampling.  When I asked, people said that the\ninterpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more\ncomplicated.\n\nAnyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the &quot;effective&quot;\nsampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency\nantialiasing filters.  For the same quality filter, higher oversampling\nlets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher\noversamplings lets you build better filters.  So, assuming the quality of\nall other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should\nallow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias\nfiltering.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t---Joel Kolstad\n&apos;, &apos;From: row0@ns1.cc.lehigh.edu (RICHARD O.

What they want\n&gt;to do is to place this thing on the Antartic ice shelf and measure the amount\n&gt;of snow fall over a period of six weeks. Every two weeks, they want to trip a\n&gt;selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the\n&gt;snow. Then by digging down into the snow, the snow fall amount can be measured\n&gt;as they come to the different color pellets.\n&gt;\n&gt;The problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold (-40 degrees)\n&gt;and a power source that wouldn\&apos;t drain. I have looked at the XR-2204 timers and\n&gt;the standard NE556 dual timers, but thier temp specs won\&apos;t go that low. Also,\n&gt;two weeks equates to 1,209,600 seconds per firing, which means one big timing\n&gt;cap ! I have found 2.2 farad (yes, Farad !) caps that have a working voltage of\n&gt;5 volts and are small in size. But again, the time of discharge at -40 or lower\n&gt;degrees isn\&apos;t linear. I was thinking of using several timers chained together\n&gt;to fire the selonid at the end of the timing period, but that blasted cold and\n&gt;the drain on a battery over six weeks is the pain. One possibility would be to\n&gt;use solar panels, but this is during the six month twilight. Anyone have any\n&gt;good ideas ?\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks in advance...\n&gt;\n&gt;-=-= Wes =-=-\n&gt;\njust a suggestion:\ntake a motorola mc14536B set it up to give you a pulse once every sec or ten\nsecs with either a RC or xtal clock input. then feed to a MC14521B as clock\ninput and decode output for 1,209,600 sec output ,might have to add a few \&apos;and\&apos;\ngates or decoder chips to get output and reset pulse back to the\&apos;521 to restart\ncycle... Trigger a oneshot from the decoded riseing edge ;the one shot then\ngoes to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet launcher..\nthese ckts require uAmps of current,between 5 - 15 volts, so a 12 volt\ngel cell of a few Amphours would last the six weeks.\nThen take the ckt board &amp; battery wrap in 3&quot; or 4&quot; of foam or build a box\nof out of the stuff...with plywood or metal exterior...\nbuild a small heater out of 10-50 Watt resistors in series to keep the battery\nand ckts warm.\n2nd thought use 2 batteries one for heater one for timer and pellet trigger.\n\nInsolate-insolate.......even though the chips state that the - AL\nrated devices are good to -55 C..

Schmidt)\nSubject: outlining of spline surface\nKeywords: spline rasterization\nLines: 38\n\n\n\tAbout a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to\nbe very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if\nanyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published \nsolutions to it.\n\n\tThe problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two\nroughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially\nstarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the \nedge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant\nbetween the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw \nthe object we \n\n1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively\n\tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the\n        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume\n\tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not\n\texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable\n\tmeasure.\n2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment\n\tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two\n\ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface.\n3) Depth sort the triangles\n4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw\n\tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is\n\talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge\n\tcolored with a special &quot;edge color&quot;\n\n\tIt is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the\nproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.\nThe net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in\nthe edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.\nThey involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting\nfrom the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem\nsounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this\narea.\n\n-Thanks\n&apos;, &quot;From: rg@futserv.austin.ibm.com (R.G.

Also, all the\n&gt;touch sensitive lights in my house start going wacko, cycling through \n&gt;their four brightness states.\n\n&gt;I presume that some ham operator with an illegal amplifier drove past\n&gt;my house (I live on a busy thoroughfare); would this be a correct presumption?\n&gt;What kind of power must he be putting out to cause the effects?  \n&gt;The affected equipment is about 100 feet from the road...\n\nHams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,\nthat a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs\nfor cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt\nradio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet \naway.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.\nIf you experience the problem frequently, it may be \ncaused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station\nnearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio \ntransmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,\netc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are\ncorrect in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.\n\nIf you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite\nchokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably\nbeing picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can\nbe installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).\nGood instructions are included with the chokes.\nIf that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your\nneighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof\nor car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things\na radio operator can do to reduce interference.\n\n-- \n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nRandall Rhea                                        Informix Software, Inc. \nProject Manager, MIS Sales/Marketing Systems    uunet!pyramid!infmx!randall\n&apos;, &quot;From: tdawson@engin.umich.edu (Chris Herringshaw)\nSubject: WingCommanderII Graphics\nOrganization: University of Michigan Engineering, Ann Arbor\nLines: 8\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: antithesis.engin.umich.edu\n\n   I was wondering if anyone knows where I can get more information about\nthe graphics in the WingCommander series, and the RealSpace system they use.\nI think it&apos;s really awesome, and wouldn&apos;t mind being able to use similar\nfeatures in programs.

In addition, the most effecent mix of \n&gt;&gt; electrical effecency, and intelegability closly mateches a 300hz-3khz\n&gt;&gt; passband.\n&gt;\n&gt;Close, but no banana (to paraphrase Garfield)...\n&gt;The reason 300-3300 Hz is used is that voice channels used to occupy\n&gt;4kHz bands when multiplexed on a trunk line. Therefore, 300Hz at the\n&gt;bottom, and 700Hz at the top of this band were filtered to minimise\n&gt;interference with the next band.\n&gt;\n&gt;Nowadays, digital trunks have made this less relevant, but the phone\n&gt;companies still see no reason to improve quality (especially for free!).\n&gt;Therefore, digital &quot;chunk of a trunk&quot; segments still have a guaranteed\n&gt;bandwidth of only 4kHz (so they can carry the equivalent of one analog\n&gt;line) at the clock rate of a standard PCM T1 or E1 digital trunk.\n&gt;\n&gt;It\&apos;s all historical...\n\n\nHere in the UK, the bandwidth restriction apparently only apply to \nlocal lines.. ie those used by the average domestic client. Private\nlines which are run from the local exchange to the leasing client are \nusually capable of a higher bandwidth if the exchange is digital.\n\nDon\&apos;t quote me on that.....

With dual supplies, the logic\ninputs still range from ground (0 Volts) to VDD.\n\nThis is a neat (well, I think so) design for a switchable-polarity\namplifier:\n\n                 +-----/\\/\\/\\-------+\n                 |                  |\n                 |    /--------\\    |\nINPUT -+-/\\/\\/\\--+----| -      |    |\n       |              |  opamp |----+------- OUTPUT\n       +-/\\/\\/\\--+----| +      |\n                 |    \\--------/\n                 |\nCONTROL\t---------X (analog switch)\n                 |\n                 |\n                ---\n                GND\n\nAll resistors are equal-value.  When the analog switch is closed,\nthe amp is inverting-gain-of-one.  With the switch open, it is\nnon-inverting-gain-of-one.

It is very unlikely, however,\n&gt;   that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs\n&gt;\n&gt;Not possible either.  You\&apos;d need about a 300 amp alternator for\n&gt;just the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow\n&gt;down on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.\n\nNow, that indeed is possible.  A good friend of mine is running about 1 KW\nPeP from his car.  Yes, he does have a second alternator.  Yes, he calls\nthe rig an &quot;electronic brake&quot; since the engine noticeably slows when the\nkey is down.\n\nMy car, unfortunately, has so much computer junk under the hood that it\&apos;s\nastonishingly sensitive to RFI.  If I key a 2W HT over the engine with\nthe hood open, the car loses timing due to the RF leaking into the \ndistributor pickup.  Very poor design.\n\nI will, however, point out that ham radio operators are usually quite willing\nto help when interference is detected.  Remember that any interference is\nwasted power; if I put out 1W in the TV band, that\&apos;s 1W that I am not putting\nout in the band I am trying to transmit on, and 1W can often be the difference\nbetween a nice card hanging on the wall, and nothing.  CBers, however, are\nusually not as helpful.  Most illegal CBers, however, will stop operation\nwhen you inform them of a problem.  The rest of them will stop operation when\nyou inform the local FCC office of the problem (in writing, and giving details\nand addresses).\n\n&gt;Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are\n&gt;required to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more\n&gt;than 10).  So if you hear &quot;This is WA1QT&quot; or some other call starting\n&gt;with A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham.\n&gt;CB\&apos;ers probably won\&apos;t sign (I don\&apos;t know that they\&apos;re even required\n&gt;to) and fire/police have other private ids.\n\nGood advice.  Hams will frequently give their call, and will never use\na &quot;handle.&quot;  They are less apt to use immense amounts of profanity as well,\nbut that\&apos;s not to say that they don\&apos;t from time to time.  \n--scott\n&apos;, &quot;From: phew@gu.uwa.edu.au (Patrick Hew)\nSubject: Re: Color pict of spinning Earth\nOrganization: The University of Western Australia\nLines: 22\nNNTP-Posting-Host: mackerel.gu.uwa.edu.au\n\nESTOP07@CONRAD.APPSTATE.EDU (*ACS) writes:\n\n&gt;Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this\n\n&gt;\tI was crusing the net earlier this year and came upon something called \n&gt;Color pict of spinning earth.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of &quot;natural&quot;, real-world scenes.\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\ndrawings.\n\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\nrespectively.\n\nJPEG is &quot;lossy&quot;, meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\&apos;t\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\nthe fact that small color details aren\&apos;t perceived as well as small details\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\ninvisible to the eye.\n\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\nfiles if you don\&apos;t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\naren\&apos;t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n\n\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\n\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n\nIf your viewing software doesn\&apos;t support JPEG directly, you\&apos;ll have to\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\n\nIt\&apos;s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\&apos;ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\n\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\n\n\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\n\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\ngray-scale images of &quot;realistic&quot; scenes; that means scanned photographs and\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\&apos;t have 24-bit display\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\n\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\nby GIF.  JPEG can\&apos;t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\n\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\nparticularly objectionable with text that\&apos;s only a few pixels high.\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\&apos;t JPEG it.\n\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\n\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\n\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\na GIF, you\&apos;ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\&apos;ll have to make for yourself.\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\nconvert well.\n\n\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\n\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B.\n\nFile\t   Size in bytes\t\tComments\n\nship.ppm\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\n\t\t\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\nship.ppm.Z\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\n\t\t\t compress doesn\&apos;t accomplish a lot, you\&apos;ll note.\n\t\t\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\nship.gif\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\n\t\t\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\n\t\t\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\n\nship.jpg95\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\n\t\t\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\n\t\t\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\nship.jpg75\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\n\t\t\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\n\t\t\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\nship.jpg50\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\n\t\t\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\n\t\t\t for, you could tell it\&apos;s been JPEGed without seeing\n\t\t\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\n\t\t\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\nship.jpg25\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\n\t\t\t JPEG\&apos;s characteristic &quot;blockiness&quot; becomes apparent\n\t\t\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\n\t\t\t Still, I\&apos;ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\n\t\t\t of poorer image quality than this.\nship.jpg5o\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\n\t\t\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\n\t\t\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\n\t\t\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\n\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\&apos;s a factor of four or five smaller\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\nratio for real-world scenes.\n\n\n[5]  What are good &quot;quality&quot; settings for JPEG?\n\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\nthe meaning of these settings.  &quot;Quality 95&quot; does NOT mean &quot;keep 95% of the\ninformation&quot;, as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\nit\&apos;s not a percentage of anything.\n\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\n\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\n\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\n\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as &quot;op art&quot;.\n\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\nquality scale.  Some programs don\&apos;t even provide a numeric scale, just\n&quot;high&quot;/&quot;medium&quot;/&quot;low&quot;-style choices.)\n\n\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\n\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\nIf you don\&apos;t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article &quot;How to find sources&quot;.\n(If you don\&apos;t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n&quot;send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources&quot; in the body.  The &quot;Anonymous FTP\nList FAQ&quot; may also be helpful --- it\&apos;s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\nthe news.answers archive.\n\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\n\n\n[6A]  If you are looking for &quot;canned&quot; software, viewers, etc:\n\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\nkind of system.  If you don\&apos;t see what you want for your machine, check out\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\n\nX Windows:\n\nJohn Bradley\&apos;s free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG,\nGIF, and other image formats.  It\&apos;s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu\nor ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called \&apos;xv-???.tar.Z\&apos; (where ??? is the\nversion number, currently 2.21); it is located in the \&apos;contrib\&apos; directory on\nexport or the \&apos;pub/xv\&apos; directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits\ninternally, which means it\&apos;s not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit\ndisplay (you\&apos;ll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn\&apos;t use XV to\nconvert full-color images to JPEG, because they\&apos;ll get color-quantized first.\nBut XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.\nCAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check\nthe &quot;save at normal size&quot; checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will\nbe blurry.\n\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\&apos;s free ImageMagick package,\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\nbasic free JPEG software.\n\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\nfile contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\n\n\nMS-DOS:\n\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\n\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\&apos;s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\nThe current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\nnot flashy, but it\&apos;s functional.\n\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\&apos;s Hiview.  The\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\&apos;s no denying that it\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\n\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\&apos;t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\nVESA driver, so don\&apos;t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\nthat the driver is missing.)\n\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\nthe net for a while, but I don\&apos;t know any stable archive location for it.\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\n\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\&apos;s JPEG implementation isn\&apos;t very good:\nit\&apos;s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\&apos;d have been nice to see a\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\n\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\&apos;t get *any*\nof them to work, you\&apos;ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\nhave hi-color hardware, don\&apos;t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\nthing with hi-color displays.)\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group\&apos;s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\n\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG&lt;=&gt;GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\nparticular, you can\&apos;t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\&apos;s proprietary\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\n\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.\n\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\&apos;s key archive site for PC-related programs\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\nrefers to directory (eg) &quot;msdos/graphics&quot; at Simtel20, that really means\n&quot;pd1:&lt;msdos.graphics&gt;&quot;.  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\nin (eg) &quot;/pub/msdos/graphics&quot;.  If you have no FTP capability, you can\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\n\nMicrosoft Windows:\n\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\ndue to Windows\&apos; system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\n\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\nBut it\&apos;s so fast you\&apos;ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\n\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\&apos;t create new JPEG\nfiles, and it doesn\&apos;t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\&apos;s\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\n\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\&apos;ll get the 386-only version,\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\n\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\n\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\nmode, not in a window.\n\nOS/2:\n\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip\n    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip\n    PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\n\nMacintosh:\n\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\&apos;s JPEG implementation, which is part of\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\&apos;re running System 6, you must also install\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\n\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\&apos;s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\n\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\&apos;s\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\nlike this behavior, some don\&apos;t.  Overall, JPEGView\&apos;s user interface is very\nwell thought out.\n\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\&apos;s faster with QuickTime.)\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\n\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\n\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG&lt;=&gt;GIF\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\n\nApple\&apos;s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\&apos;s tool, and it\&apos;s\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\nit, as it\&apos;s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\n\nStorm Technology\&apos;s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\&apos;t\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\ndownloaded image file to \&apos;JPEG\&apos; to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\n\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\ndon\&apos;t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\n\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\nJPEG file to \&apos;JPEG\&apos; to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\n\nAmiga:\n\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\n\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\&apos;s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\n\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\n\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\n\nIf you\&apos;re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\n\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are &quot;AugJPEG&quot;, &quot;NewAmyJPEG&quot;,\n&quot;VJPEG&quot;, and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\nit\&apos;s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\n\nAtari ST:\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\n\nI have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,\nbut surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.\n\nAcorn Archimedes:\n\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\n\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\n\nThere\&apos;s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\n\n\nPortable software for almost any system:\n\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\&apos;ll also need a viewer program.\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\n\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\&apos;s files.\n\n\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\n\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\nThe &quot;official&quot; archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don\&apos;t forget to\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\nIf you are on a PC and don\&apos;t know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\n(If you don\&apos;t know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\narticle &quot;How to find sources&quot;, referred to at the top of section 6.)\n\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG &quot;JFIF&quot; format and image\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\n\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\nanything that\&apos;s free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you\&apos;d like to\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\n\n\n[7]  What\&apos;s all this hoopla about color quantization?\n\nMost people don\&apos;t have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\ncolors.  This process is called &quot;color quantization&quot;.  (This is something\nof a misnomer, &quot;color selection&quot; would be a better term.  We\&apos;re stuck with\nthe standard usage though.)\n\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\n\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\nThis happens because JPEG\&apos;s lossiness affects each pixel a little\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets &quot;smeared&quot;\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\n\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\&apos;s nearly meaningless to talk about\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\nposted images described as &quot;256-color JPEG&quot;.  This tells me that the poster\n(a) hasn\&apos;t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\nnumber of colors just isn\&apos;t a useful concept for JPEG.)\n\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\npalette, and the format doesn\&apos;t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\&apos;t have to.\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\&apos;re stuck with the sender\&apos;s\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\&apos;t use a high-quality color quantization\nalgorithm, you\&apos;re out of luck.\n\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\nfor all users whose machines don\&apos;t match the sender\&apos;s display hardware.\nJPEG\&apos;s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\&apos;s display\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\&apos;re stuck forevermore with what was\nsent.\n\nIt\&apos;s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\&apos;s\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\n\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\nhardware already: 15-bit &quot;hi-color&quot; PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\nin a machine-independent fashion.\n\n\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\n\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\ncoding.  This article\&apos;s long enough already, so I\&apos;m not going to say more\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\n\n\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\n\nThere\&apos;s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\n\nSaying &quot;-Q 100&quot; to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\n&quot;-sample 1x1&quot; to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\n\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\nvalue; it\&apos;s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\n\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\n\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\n\n\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\n\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\nstandards organizations.\n\nSince we can\&apos;t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\n&quot;do their own thing&quot;, and as a result their programs aren\&apos;t compatible with\nanybody else\&apos;s.\n\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\nthat\&apos;s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a &quot;low-end&quot; format that transports\n    pixels and not much else.\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\n    a &quot;high-end&quot; format that will let you record just about everything you\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\&apos;s not likely that adding JPEG to the\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\nof JPEG-related products; it\&apos;s reasonably likely that future commercial\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\n\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported &quot;lowest common\ndenominator&quot;; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\n\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\&apos;s QuickTime\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\n\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\&apos;s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\n\n\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\n\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\&apos;t read, it\&apos;s likely\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\n\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \&apos;JFIF\&apos;.\n\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\n    &quot;raw JPEG&quot; file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\n    it\&apos;s worth a try, anyway.\n\n3.  HSI files start with \&apos;hsi1\&apos;.  You\&apos;re out of luck unless you have HSI\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\n    won\&apos;t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\n\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \&apos;JFIF\&apos;).  Strip off\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\n\n5.  Anything else: it\&apos;s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\n    try stripping off everything before that.\n\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\n\n\t&quot;begin&quot; line\n\tM_]C_X ...\n\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\n\n\t&quot;begin&quot; line\n\tM:\&apos;-I ...\n\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\n\n\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\n\nThe JPEG spec defines two different &quot;back end&quot; modules for the final output\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\n\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&amp;T, and Mitsubishi.\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\nfrom these companies.  (The &quot;fair use&quot; doctrine allows people to implement\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\nat best.)\n\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\&apos;t great enough to justify the\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\n\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\n\n\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\n\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\nfirst time around.\n\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\nfree JPEG software.  It\&apos;s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\n\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\n(If you\&apos;re wondering why, it\&apos;s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\nthat\&apos;s a mighty limited capability!)\n\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\ntransmission of images, but you don\&apos;t want to use it as an intermediate\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\n\n\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\n\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\&apos;s far better to make a JPEG from\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\nloss of quality.\n\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\ndon\&apos;t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\n\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\nDon\&apos;t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\&apos;t\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\n\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (&quot;ghost&quot; edges).  Do yourself\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\nsystem, XV\&apos;s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\nway to do this.)\n\ncjpeg\&apos;s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\n\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually &quot;dithered&quot; to fool\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\&apos;t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\nTo get around this, you want to &quot;smooth&quot; the GIF image before compression.\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\nthan you\&apos;d get without smoothing.\n\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\ncapability is built in.  Try &quot;-smooth 10&quot; or so when converting GIFs.\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\nthe output image, which you don\&apos;t want.  If you are an image processing\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\&apos;s built-in smoother is\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\n\nThe upshot of all this is that &quot;cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10&quot; is probably a\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\nimage, you\&apos;ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\n\n\n---------------------\n\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\n\n-- \n\t\t\ttom lane\n\t\t\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\n&apos;, &apos;From: spencer@med.umich.edu (Spencer W.

If you need more \n&gt;info, you  can mail me at   eylerken@u.washington.edu\n&gt;\n&gt;thanks in advance.\n&gt;\n&gt;:ken\n&gt;:eylerken@u.washington.edu\n\n\nHere at Lewis and Clark College we have recently installed a Digital Film\nsystem (based on the Mac Quadra) that does non-linear, full digital editing.\n\nIf you\&apos;re considering such a system, here are the pros and cons:\n\nFor the educational environment, this system is excellent.  We use it to\nproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local\nnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the\nimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the\nvideo to the Net.\n\nWe also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for\nuse by the Lewis &amp; Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\n\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been\nunable to deliver.  Our system produces &quot;near VHS&quot; quality at 30 fields per\nsecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60\nfields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some\nfind distracting.\n\nIf you can get past this problem, you\&apos;ll find the Adobe Premier editing \nsoftware quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of\ndifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.\n\nBecause of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you\&apos;ve ever\nused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you\&apos;ll recognize the methodology\nand the user interface.\n\nThe total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21&quot; Apple mon-\nitor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),\nComposite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.\n\nFor you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality\nthat will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more\neffects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based system\nwill look better.\n\nWe use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.  Each for what each does best!\n\n\nDan Snodgrass\nMedia Services\nLewis &amp; Clark College\nPortland\n&apos;, &quot;From: rwf2@ns1.cc.lehigh.edu (ROBERT WILLIAM FUSI)\nSubject: Bike advice\nOrganization: Lehigh University\nLines: 11\n\nI have an &apos;89 Kawasaki KX 80.

Basically it changes things\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user&apos;s\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user&apos;s\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\n   other users.\n\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don&apos;t need to\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\n\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\n\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\n\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\n\n    o User Interface Panels\n\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\n\tfaster frame rates)\n\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\n\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn&apos;t support the\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can&apos;t, but because\n   I don&apos;t have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\n\n  Server(s):\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\n\n    o Transparent Client Management\n\n    o Client Message Handling\n\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\naccepting and\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\napplication writer\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\n\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\n\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\n        initialisers you want.\n\n    o Event Handler Registration:\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE &amp; TERMINATE)\n\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\n\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\n    from which to choose.\n\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\n\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\n        any initialization you want to do.\n\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\n\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\n\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\n\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\n\n    That&apos;s all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\n    three world servers I&apos;ve provided:\n\n        generic - 81 lines\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\n                           stairs!

Several outlets\n&gt; are the old &apos;two prong&apos; type, without the ground.  Naturally,\n&gt; the wire feeding these outlets is 12/2, WITHOUT the ground\n&gt; wire.  I noticed at the fusebox that some circuits have the\n&gt; 12/2 with ground, and that on these circuits, the ground\n&gt; wire was tied to the same bus as the neutral (white) wire.\n&gt; \n&gt; SO..  Here&apos;s my question.  It seems to me that I&apos;d have the\n&gt; same electrical circuit if I hooked the jumper from the neutral\n&gt; over to the ground screw on new &apos;three prong&apos; grounding outlets.\n&gt; What&apos;s wrong with my reasoning here?  \n\nNo.  No.  NOOO!!!\n\nThe ground (green) wire is for safety.  No current is supposed to flow in it\nunder normal conditions.  This means that there&apos;s normally no voltage drop in\nit either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if\nyou&apos;re grounded in some other way at the same time.  \n\nThe neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for\nthe hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there&apos;s a voltage drop.  If you\nplug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly \nmeasure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.  \n\nThey are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere,\nrepeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things\nlike sub-panels.)\n\nWhat you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is \nto use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact,\ndepending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.\n\nThere is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and\nnews.answers.  It goes into great detail on these issues (including GFCIs) and\nyou should probably read it before asking any more questions.  I&apos;ll mail a copy\nto you, append a copy here, and will ask the writers to cross-post it here in\nthe future. \n\n\t--- Jamie Hanrahan, Kernel Mode Systems, San Diego CA\nInternet:  jeh@cmkrnl.com  Uucp: uunet!cmkrnl!jeh  CIS: 74140,2055\n\n&quot;, &quot;From: erikb@idt.unit.no (Erik Brenn)\nSubject: graphics formats\nReply-To: erikb@idt.unit.no (Erik Brenn)\nOrganization: Norwegian Institue of Technology\nLines: 14\n\nI&apos;m currently looking for information about different graphics\nformats, especially PPM, PCX BMP and perhaps GIF.\nDoes anyone know if there exist any files at some site\nthat describes these formats ???\n\nThanks !\n\n\n-- \n          ~~~                       \n         (o o)           | Erik Brenn ,email: erikb@idt.unit.no\n        (  O  )   oOOO   | Faculty of Computer Science &amp; Telematics\n         \\\\_//    / /    | The Norwegian Institute of Technology, Trondheim\n-oOOO--------------------| Not to make sense, just cents ! \n&quot;, &apos;From: hl7204@eehp22 (H L)\nSubject: Re: Graphics Library Package\nOrganization: University of Illinois at Urbana\nLines: 2\n\n  \n\n&apos;, &apos;From: rdc8@cunixf.cc.columbia.edu (Robert D Castro)\nSubject: Flashing anyone?\nKeywords: flashing\nNntp-Posting-Host: cunixf.cc.columbia.edu\nOrganization: Columbia University\nLines: 23\n\nHello all,\n\nOn my bike I have hazard lights (both front and back turn signals\nflash).

I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture\nusing a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot\nquicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one\n(1.5).\n\n   They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite\nnicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by\n3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it\nwasn&apos;t 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he\nincreased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10&lt;-&gt;12 fps. \n\n   Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don&apos;t know\nwhat model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime\ncould play back at the same speed even on an LCII.\n\n   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having\na little bit of trouble.  And this wasn&apos;t even from the hardisk!  This was\nfrom memory!\n\n   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some\nhardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the \nanimation (like supposedly MacroMind&apos;s Accelerator?)?\n\n   Don&apos;t misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.\n\n   But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, I can\nclaim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256,000+ colors in \nmy computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with Scala MM210.\n\n   But I agree, if we consider MPEG stuff, I think a multimedia consumer\nlow-priced box has a lot of market...

It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at\n65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be\nable to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)\nand a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be\ncheap.  \n\nMy first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each\ncompariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input\nwent to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).\n\nThe first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I\nneeded to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the\ncompariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my\ncircuit would not detect it.   \n\nThe second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then\nthe smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In\nfact the difference between completely black and completely white is\nonly 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the\nvideo signals to make this work.  \n\nThere are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require \nsplit supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariator\nwith three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supply\ncircuit.  \n\nAt this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistor\ncircuit.  Transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick...\n\nUnfortunately, I am way out of my league when It comes to designing\ntransistor circuits, so I am appealing to the net for help.  Any\nideas, tips, circuits, pointers, references, etc. would be greatly\nappreciated.  \n\nOh yes, I only sample the output of this thing every second or so, so\nI don&apos;t need a fast response time at all, however, I haven&apos;t found a\nway to take advantage of that fact.\n\nThanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give.

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little\n&gt;  time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing\n&gt;  program.\n\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\n\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\n\nNow, the phrasing of this question says &quot;if a line intersects a polygon&quot;, so\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\n\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\nnew language called PostScript.  (See &quot;PostScript Language&quot;, by Adobe Systems\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\n\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then &quot;outputs&quot; the answer.  By\n&quot;output&quot;, we mean the program executes a command called &quot;showpage&quot;, which\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\nthe original problem.\n\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \n\n\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\n\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\n\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\&apos;s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\n\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\n\n\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\n\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\n\tother words, will it halt?\n\n\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\n\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\n\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\n\tout to be undecidable.\n\n\nI won\&apos;t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\n\nA couple of references might be:\n\n1.

By the well known\nDobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman &amp; D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.\n37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to\nHamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an\nacronym) is probably only NP-complete.

They are essentially\ndouble conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz.\nThe receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used\npreviouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham\nRadio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.\n\n  The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used\nat these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design\nof this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).\n\n  While using this would have let me reduce the &quot;external&quot; IF count on\nreceive, it didn\&apos;t really offer all that much help on transmit so I\ndidn\&apos;t bother with it.\n\n  The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2\nMHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios\nactually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and\nspeed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data\nstream is another matter entirely.\n\n  Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a\n&quot;beacon&quot; test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow\ndue to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO\nalso shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even\nthough the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes\nof the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of\na second.\n\n  I\&apos;ve been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in\nand get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland\nIDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the\nproceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running\nlow on resources of time, money and energy.\n\n  If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW\nID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma\nMtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally\npolarized.\n\n  I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly\napproach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and\nyou might want to carefully consider your &quot;target&quot;.  If you can\&apos;t\narrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think\nyou\&apos;ll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by\nmultipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS.\nFor more details, see the 10th CNC.

And we, as \n&gt;motorcyclists, can be in the worst of vulnerable positions around a drunk\n&gt;driver.  (Alert readers might remember that last year I witnessed a DWI\n&gt;accident (right bloody in front of me), and was unable to save the life \n&gt;of one of the participants, as I reported here.)  Also, drunk driving by\n&gt;motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death, which raises the\n&gt;insurance rates, forces stupidly restrictive laws, and turns the public\n&gt;against those of us who ride responsibly.\n&gt;\n&gt;In my view, drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence.\n&gt;It is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue,\n&gt;but a genuine safety issue.

I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from \nDennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my \&apos;85 FJ1100. They are rated\nat 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to\nthe relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay\npins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used\na crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.\n\tI installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front\nfairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube\nframe used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to\ndo this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two\nvertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing\nfollows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing.\nThe compressor is about 2&quot; in diameter and about 5&quot; long.\n\tThe relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small\nso there should be plenty of good places for it.\n\tI found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to\nmount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side\njust in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the\nhorns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where\nthe gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough\nroom to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice\ncut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.\n\tThe short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out\nabout an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look\nclosely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight\nahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).\n\tIf you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try\nto explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them\nfirst.\n\tHow do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound\nmore like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock.\nI have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has\nnot blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).\n\tI\&apos;ve repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though\nthey know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping\nthe pedestrians on the sidewalk.\nThe bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to\nthose stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives)\nand are relatively easy to install on the FJ.

After\nexperimenting with different aperture settings and screen\nbrightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable\ncontrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no\nvisible contrast bands.\n\nTo minimize the exposure time the display program built 255\ndifferent 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels\nthat had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254,\netc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was\nvery fast to &apos;or&apos; onto the screen in sequence. Creating these\nframes sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera\nshutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote\ndirectly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.\n\nOur biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the\ntop left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took\nan extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the\nprocessors took the trouble to manually move the all images into\nthe center of the print.

Digital immortality.\n\nThe basic idea behind &quot;digital immortality&quot; is that computer networks   \nare here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them\nwill be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the\nartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they\&apos;ll be put in different\nformats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they\&apos;ll be\nthere...and someone will dig them up.  \n \nIf that doesn\&apos;t interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique\nand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes\nand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang\nas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is \nbreathed into your work...and by merit of it\&apos;s stimulus, it will \ntravel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.\n \nSpectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and \nlet the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own\ncopies of the images to look at when you\&apos;ve got the gumption...\nthat\&apos;s what they\&apos;re here for.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHERE?             \n\nOTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  \n \n \t141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site\n\t\t\n\tsunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite \n\t(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)\n\nMerely &quot;anonymous FTP&quot; to either site on Internet and change to the\nappropriate directory.  Don\&apos;t forget to get busy and use the &quot;bin&quot;\ncommand to make sure you\&apos;re in binary.\n\nOTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North\nAmerica....the following systems have a substancial supply of\nOTIStuff...\n\tUnderground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines\n\tCyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n \nHOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?\n              \nWhat happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   \nphoto, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put\nit in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me\n(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,\nit will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works\nare also welcome.\n\nOTIS\&apos; directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \nsee.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at \nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\ntougher to find.  If you can\&apos;t find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \n\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \n\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we\&apos;ll\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \nemailing).\n\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send\ncopies to:\n\nThe OTIS Project\nc/o Ed Stastny\nPO BX 241113\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113\n\nI will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  \nscan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\ndirectory where it\&apos;s finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \n \nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\ncontact me and we\&apos;ll arrange things.\n\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5&quot;\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\nThis is good for people who don\&apos;t have direct access to encoders or FTP,\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\nJPG.  If you can\&apos;t...we can convert from most formats...we\&apos;d just rather\nnot have to.\n\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\ncan stand.  Even if you don\&apos;t have stuff to contribute, you can send\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \nget a slab-o-OTIS.\n\nAs of 04/21/93, we\&apos;re at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISTRIBUTION?\n\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \n \nIt would also be nice if you\&apos;d send me a note when you did post images\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\n\nIt\&apos;s the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\nBBS system....or even just post this &quot;info-file&quot; there.  It would be\nkeen of you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUSE?\n\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\nyou\&apos;ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the &quot;.rm&quot; file for    \nthe image or series of images...or in the &quot;Artists&quot; directory under the \nArtists name.  If permission isn\&apos;t explicitly given, then you\&apos;ll have \nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I\&apos;ll get in contact with the artist for \nyou, or give you their contact information.\n \nWhen you DO use permitted work, it\&apos;s always courteous to let the artist\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\ncompensation for their files.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNAMING IMAGES?\n\nPlease keep the names of your files in &quot;dos&quot; format.  That means, keep\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\nfour digit &quot;code&quot; for the series of images, plus the series number.\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci\&apos;s fifth mechanical drawing would be something\nlike:\n \n\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\n\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\nremain intact on all systems.  \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\n\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\ncase they\&apos;d like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\naddress or other information you\&apos;d like people to know.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHMMM?!\n\nThat\&apos;s about it for now.  More &quot;guidelines&quot; will be added as needed.\nYour input is expected.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  \n \t     (a sumerian deity) or it\&apos;s followers, be they pope, priest,\n\t     or ezine administrator.

The files will go to the public at large.  \n\t     It\&apos;s possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone\n\t     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.  \n    \t     Unless you\&apos;ve given permission for that, it\&apos;s illegal.  OTIS\n\t     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights\n\t     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to \n\t     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed \n\t     electronically.  If you don\&apos;t want your images distributed     \n\t     all-over, don\&apos;t upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is\n\t     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or\n\t     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not \n\t     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        \n\t     screen-printed clothing, etc).

Is there any real-world application\n&gt;for Tesla coils today ?\n&gt;\n&gt;David Prutchi\n\nFirst of all, realize that Tesla invented AC power generators, motors,\ntransformers, conductors, etc. Technically, *ALL* transformers are Tesla\ncoils.  In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean\nan &quot;air core resonant transformer&quot;. The TV flyback version Tesla\ncoil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for\ndiagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called\n&quot;Oscillating Shuttle Circuit&quot; (OSC). Generally OSC\&apos;s are highly\nefficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors,\nwhich are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active\nreactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve\nefficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core\nresonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI\nfor wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer\nscreen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil\nfrom it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all\nTesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter\nand die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind\nto a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat,\ngas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and\ntelegraph for communication.

The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when\n(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.\nThe first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max\nFriz\&apos;s famous design, but with an overhead &quot;point cam&quot; (see below for\nmore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground\nclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so\nthat the ground clearance was substantially increased:\n\n\n      ==@==   &lt;-Springer motor (front)\n                 Viking motor (front) -&gt;   \\=@=/\n\nThis is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved\naround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn\nin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting\nrods to accomodate the stroke.\n\nThe engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still\nunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and\nand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was\nrequired to drive both overhead valves.\n\nJust as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a\npressurized stream of oil to power the &quot;waterwheel&quot; which kept the lobe\nspinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal\nengineering fixes was that until the engine\&apos;s oil pressure came up to\nnormal, the engine\&apos;s valve timing would be more or less random,\nresulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a\nlittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the\nbeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to\npressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,\nuses an electric oil pump. Wimps).\n\nDespite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively\nfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily\nlose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even\nhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This\nwas feasible because it was a racing engine.\n\nWith just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers\nbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an\nalmost perfect point:\n\n                    /\\\n                   /()\\   &lt;-lobe\n                  / XX \\  &lt;-complex linkage (not shown due to\n valvestems -&gt;   / \\  / \\    complexity)\n                |  |   | |\n                |  |===| |\n                    =0=  &lt;---piston\n                     |\n                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical\n                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the\n                             ground, and this drawing doesn\&apos;t show the\n                             curvature because there was none in the\n                             head itself. The bore curve would start\n                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in\n                             this diagram\n\n\nThe effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of\nthe day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of\nfinned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the\nname.\n\nThe Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it\nworked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary\ntechnology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that\nracing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines\nwere raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate\n(approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two\nSpringers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and\ndown that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as\ntwenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modern\nrecord of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle\nhistorians discount this story.\n\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\nDoD# 0863      |I\&apos;d be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1a * If you aren\&apos;t sliding, you aren\&apos;t riding.\n                                                                                                          \n----\n+===============================================================+\n|COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)|\n|Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|\n+===============================================================+\n&apos;, &quot;From: tony@morgan.demon.co.uk (Tony Kidson)\nSubject: Re: What is it with Cats and Dogs ???! \nDistribution: world\nOrganization: The Modem Palace\nReply-To: tony@morgan.demon.co.uk\nX-Newsreader: Simple NEWS 1.90 (ka9q DIS 1.21)\nLines: 21\n\nIn article &lt;1qk3mqINN72e@emory.mathcs.emory.edu&gt; gnome@pd.org writes:\n\n&gt;james.bessette (jimbes@cbnewsj.cb.att.com) wrote:\n&gt;&gt;In article &lt;6130328@hplsla.hp.com&gt; kens@hplsla.hp.com (Ken Snyder) writes:\n&gt;&gt;Ask the breeder why they also chase BMWs also.\n&gt;\n&gt;Cam chain.\n&gt;\n\nIn that case why do they chase ST1100s &amp; Goldwings?\n\nTony\n\n\n+---------------+------------------------------+-------------------------+\n|Tony Kidson    | ** PGP 2.2 Key by request ** |Voice +44 81 466 5127    |\n|Morgan Towers, |  The Cat has had to move now |E-Mail(in order)         |\n|Morgan Road,   |  as I&apos;ve had to take the top |tony@morgan.demon.co.uk  |\n|Bromley,       |  off of the machine.         |tny@cix.compulink.co.uk  |\n|England BR1 3QE|Honda ST1100 -=&lt;*&gt;=- DoD# 0801|100024.301@compuserve.com|\n+---------------+------------------------------+-------------------------+\n&quot;, &quot;From: frog@sarvax.cmhnet.org (Jeff &apos;Frog&apos; Campbell)\nSubject: Re: BMW MOA members read this!\nOrganization: Comp3, Inc.\nLines: 28\n\nFrom article &lt;C5px3n.Kw0@murdoch.acc.Virginia.EDU&gt;, by cdw2t@dayhoff.med.Virginia.EDU (Dances With Federal Rangers):\n&gt; In article &lt;1098@rider.UUCP&gt; joe@rider.cactus.org writes:\n&gt;&gt;cdw2t@dayhoff.med.Virginia.EDU (Dances With Federal Rangers) writes:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;]I&apos;m going to buy a BMW just to cast a vote for Groucho.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;I thought you were gonna buy a BMW for its superior power and handling...\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, but the 535i was just a tad out of my price range...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ObMotoWashing: Is it just me, or does everyone cut their finger(s) on the\n&gt; Evil Cotterpin (tm), lurking somewhere in the dark recesses of the back end\n&gt; of the bike, when giving the prized moto a bath?

Therefore there would\n&gt;be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of\n&gt;detecting whether some one had a radio in their car.  \n&gt; \nFrom my rather rusty knowledge of radio, most radio receivers use a superhet \ncircuit, so that the incoming signal is mixed with a local oscillator, giving \na fixed intermediate frequency (IF) that is more easily amplified. The\ndetector detectors work by picking up IF re-radiated from your radar \ndetector. In Britain, where one has/used to pay for a TV licence, there \nare/were TV detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn&apos;t \npaid their licence fee. They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the\nroof, and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF. \n\nI wonder how much of the IF is radiated back from the detector antenna, and \nhow much from the rest of the module. It might be worth putting the detector \nin a proper RF shielded enclosure.\n\n--\n Andrew Daviel, Vancouver, Canada &lt;advax@triumf.ca&gt;\n  finger advax@reg.triumf.ca for PGP key\n&quot;, &apos;From: moseley@u.washington.edu (Steve L.

But by including countersteering\n|&gt; theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at\n|&gt; the time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn.\n|&gt; And that was my original point.\n|&gt; \n|&gt; Mike\n\nWhile I agree with you on that formal training is essential for safe riding,\nI disagree strongly with your original point. The point of formal training \nmust be to prepare riders for the road. Preparedness is in my opinion\nto know as much as possible. So, to exclude some aspects of riding a bike \nin a course is wrong IMHO. Now to countersteering in particular.\nCountersteering is something that must be trained. A common reaction among \nnew bikers (or bicycle riders) in an emergency situation, is to steer the \nmotorcycle like a bicycle. As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the\ndirection opposite to what was intended. Needless to say, this is dangerous.\nI have a specific example: A rider in a left turn. The rider thinks he/she\nis to close to the right shoulder of the road, and tries to steer the \nmotorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right \nhandle. The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road. \nA worse scenario: The same rider, same turn. In the middle of the turn\nthe rider sees a truck coming towards him/her. The panicking rider tries\nto steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it.\n\nThe main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency \nsituations, AND what to do if in one. Thus, the knowledge (and training) of\ncountersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course.\n-- \nstaal@idt.unit.no  \n\n&quot;, &apos;From: mcguire@cs.utexas.edu (Tommy Marcus McGuire)\nSubject: Re: Should liability insurance be required?\nOrganization: CS Dept, University of Texas at Austin\nLines: 42\nDistribution: usa\nNNTP-Posting-Host: cash.cs.utexas.edu\n\nIn article &lt;1993Apr15.153312.4125@research.nj.nec.com&gt; behanna@syl.nj.nec.com (Chris BeHanna) writes:\n&gt;In article &lt;tcora-140493155620@b329-gator-3.pica.army.mil&gt; tcora@pica.army.mil (Tom Coradeschi) writes:\n&gt;&gt;In article &lt;1993Apr14.125209.21247@walter.bellcore.com&gt;,\n[...]\n&gt;&gt;BZZZT!

If you find line-level input to both\nchips, one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily.  \n\nIf you want to pick off a near-line-level signal, suitable for feeding to an\noutboard amp, the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good\nenough.

Advantages include the fact\n    that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates\n    the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.\n\n2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new \n    Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey\n    unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather\n    are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose\n    value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper\n    than upper Aerostich.\n\nRequirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other \nlayers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i\&apos;d prefer a zip-out \nlining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows, \nshoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a \nreasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would \nbe a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below\nfreezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.\n\nPlease fire away with suggestions, comments, etc...\n\nSteve\n--\n-- \n Steve Andersen  DoD #0239                               andersen@me.udel.edu\n (302) 832-0136                                     andersen@zr1.ccm.udel.edu\n 1992 Ducati 907 I.E.                                      1987 Yamaha SRX250\n &quot;Life is simply a consequence of the complexities of carbon chemistry...&quot;\n&apos;, &apos;From: npet@bnr.ca (Nick Pettefar)\nSubject: Re: Fortune-guzzler barred from bars!\nNntp-Posting-Host: bmdhh299\nOrganization: BNR Europe Ltd, Maidenhead, UK\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]\nLines: 43\n\nDavid Karr, on the Tue, 20 Apr 1993 01:01:01 GMT wibbled:\n: In article &lt;C5qtvL.M73@dartvax.dartmouth.edu&gt; Russell.P.Hughes@dartmouth.edu (Knicker Twister) writes:\n: &gt;In article &lt;1993Apr19.141959.4057@bnr.ca&gt;\n: &gt;npet@bnr.ca (Nick Pettefar) writes:\n: &gt;\n: &gt;&gt; With regards to the pub brawl, he might have a history of such things.\n: &gt;&gt; Just because he was a biker doesn\&apos;t make him out to be a reasonable\n: &gt;&gt; person.

My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L.  For the\nbottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the\n46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, I have\nlarge, muscular thighs, and no, I didn&apos;t use the thighmaster to get\nthem :-).  The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the\nwaist, and too small in the arms.  I can&apos;t imagine finding a one-piece\nsize that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it&apos;s\nproblems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, and\nwhen I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).\n\nI can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are\nin some way different from us real folks.\n\nAlso, even though it&apos;s related to convienience, you look pretty damn\nwierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands.\nI&apos;ve gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a\nstore wearing the whole suit, since you can&apos;t fit the top and bottom\nin any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my\nsidecar rig :-).  With the two piece, I unzip the pants (I generally\nleave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall\ndown unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight),\nstuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit),\nand run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I&apos;ll be\nrunning errands, I just wear my V-Pilot jacket, but that&apos;s just me...\n\nAs far as crash protection, I&apos;d say that both suits are probably\nequal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece\nprovides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by\n3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around\nthe waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.\n\nSo I&apos;d have to vote for the two piece.  Despite the slightly odd fit,\nI still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I\nown.

I would expect that using the same algorithm, a RISC\n&gt; |&gt; processor should be able to approach full-screen full-motion animation,\n&gt; |&gt; though as you\&apos;ve implied, the processor will be taxed more with highly\n&gt; |&gt; dynamic material.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    Sean, I don\&apos;t want to get into a \&apos;mini-war\&apos; by what I am going to say,\n&gt; but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are\n&gt; claiming on the Centris, you\&apos;ll see why (please, no-flames, I reserve\n&gt; those for c.s.m.a :-) )\n&gt;\n&gt;    I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show, and Apple had a\n&gt; booth there.  I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture\n&gt; using a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot\n&gt; quicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one\n&gt; (1.5).\n\nThat is in fact the current version (it only came out in December).\n\n&gt;    They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite\n&gt; nicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by\n&gt; 3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it\n&gt; wasn\&apos;t 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he\n&gt; increased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10&lt;-&gt;12 fps.\n&gt;\n&gt;    Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don\&apos;t know\n&gt; what model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime\n&gt; could play back at the same speed even on an LCII.\n&gt;\n&gt;    Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having\n&gt; a little bit of trouble.  And this wasn\&apos;t even from the hardisk!  This was\n&gt; from memory!\n\nMy test movie was created at 320*240 resolution, it wasn\&apos;t being scaled up.\nScaling was a very CPU-intensive operation with the original QuickTime (1.0);\nthe current version has optimizations for ratios like 4:1 (160*120 -&gt; 320*240),\nbut even so, I\&apos;m prepared to believe that the performance isn\&apos;t as good as\nwith playing back an actual 320*240 movie.

A lot of older minis used it.  Sun still does on their server\nmodels.  There are several different speeds of SMD, and I think that the \nFuji drive you have is rated at about 24 Mb/sec (thats megabits).  There\nused to be several companies that made couplers for the PC (Interphase in\nTexas being one), but I think that the market pretty much has dried up.\nControllers for this type of drive are readily available for VME buses\nthough.

I have noticed that the waveform \nsynthesizer that I am using (Analogic 2020) has some relatively large\ncommon mode noise on it.  I am using this synthesizer to &apos;null&apos; out another\ntransient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uV) several hundred \ntimes.  The 2020 has about 1-3 mVp-p of common mode noise and this tends to\nmake my measurements hard to repeat.  (The noise is not quite in sync with \nline frequency, and on a spectrum analyzer, the main component is about 64Hz).\n\nHow can I get rid of the noise?  When I look at the spectrum using an\nHP 3582A (audio range analyzer), the noise goes away the minute I switch to \n&apos;isolation&apos; on the input.  I am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the \ninput since it will read accurately down to DC.\n\nAlso, if I use a differential amplifier (IA) to solve the problem, \nhow important is it to use one of these &apos;shield drivers&apos; (an amp connected \nto the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused \nby different cable capacitances)?  If anyone can suggest a good IC IA for \nuse with transient signals with content from 1KHz to about 300KHz, I would\nappreciate it.  \n&quot;, &apos;From: dkusswur@falcon.depaul.edu (Daniel C.

We\&apos;ll be riding some twisty, \n   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).\n\nCommunication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler\nback every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled\nMagna, we can hear each other.  It\&apos;s only above, say, 45 MPH that you \ncan\&apos;t really communicate.\n\nBalance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how\nthey\&apos;re going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately\nand lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning\nthing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a\npain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay\nperpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn\nand WHIP AROUND until they\&apos;re in the `correct\&apos; position.  This always\nscrews up the line I\&apos;ve picked out.\n\nHere\&apos;s my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:\n\t- attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.\n\t- Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not\n\t  get on/off unless I say you can.  (I\&apos;ve had people try to dismount\n\t  in traffic, just as I\&apos;m pulling in to a parking space!)\n\t- Muffler gets HOT! (\&apos;Nuff said)\n\t- We get *GOOD* traction.  We\&apos;re not going to fall over.  (Many\n\t  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)\n\t- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you\&apos;re sitting upright and\n\t  we\&apos;re going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you\&apos;re\n\t  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel\n\t  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  \n\t- Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be \n\t  gradual, so I can compensate.\n\t- Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.\n\t- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right \n\t  thing -- I\&apos;ve driven many miles on this thing, and know how\n\t  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to\n\t  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to \n\t  watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84, \n\t  and whever we topped 35 mph, she\&apos;d holler, &quot;SLOW DOWN! I\&apos;M SCARED&quot; \n\t  I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with \n\t  the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.\n\t  Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the\n\t  instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her\n\t  experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to \n\t  trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)\n\nUsually I\&apos;ll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, \ntires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers.\nHelps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.\n\nWatch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little\nmudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will\nbe nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones.\nIt doesn\&apos;t help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the \nfirst trip!\n\nGood luck -- have fun!\n--\nDON\&apos;T DRINK SOAP!

They\nalso give an example of how to &quot;emulate&quot; strokeadjust in PostScript\nenvironments where it is absent.\n\nThe suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints\nof a line using the following formula for each coordinate:\n\n\tnew_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25\n\t\nDoing this we end up with all coordinates ending in &quot;.25&quot;.  From\nreading I thought that what they might actually do is:\n\n\tnew_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25\n\t\nThis results in all the coordinates ending in either &quot;0.25&quot; or &quot;0.75&quot; \nwhichever is closer.\n\nBy doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript, I find that\nneither of these is what DPS really uses.

I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture\n&gt;using a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the\nspot\n&gt;quicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one\n&gt;(1.5).\n\nVersion 1.5 of Quicktime is, as has been stated, the current version of\nthe software. The older version is 1.0, and 1.6 is on the horizon in the\nnot too distant future.\n\n&gt;   They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played\nback quite\n&gt;nicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to\n25x by\n&gt;3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice\nthat it\n&gt;wasn&apos;t 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then\nhe\n&gt;increased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10&lt;-&gt;12 fps. \n\nQuicktime does a much better job of playing back movies at size than it\ndoes playing back resized movies. Apparently the process of expanding\neach frame&apos;s image and dithering the resultant bitmap to the appropriate\nbit depth is pretty processor-intensive. There are optimizers that work\npretty well for showing movies at double size, but if you drop to 1.9x\nsize or increase to 2.1x size, performance suffers dramatically.\n\n&gt;   Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra\n(don&apos;t know\n&gt;what model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the\nQuicktime\n&gt;could play back at the same speed even on an LCII.\n\nHe lied. :-) Quicktime is very CPU dependent. He was probably confused by\nthe fact that QT is locked to an internal timecode, and will play in the\nsame amount of time on any machine. However, an LC will drop frames in\norder to keep the sound and video synced up.\n\nThe Centris and Quadras have similar CPUs and will thus boast similar\nperformance, though the Quadras will be a bit faster due to marginally\nfaster clock speeds and somewhat different architecture.\n\n&gt;   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was\nhaving\n&gt;a little bit of trouble.  And this wasn&apos;t even from the hardisk!  This\nwas\n&gt;from memory!\n&gt;\n&gt;   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some\n&gt;hardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the \n&gt;animation (like supposedly MacroMind&apos;s Accelerator?)?\n\nI expect that the version of the Quicktime software you saw was 1.0 -- I\nwas using was 1.5. One of the new codecs in v1.5 allows video at nearly\ntwice the size and the same frame rate as what version 1.0 could handle.\nThe Centris 650 I saw was a plain-vanilla, with the exception of the nice\nspeakers that were playing the sound, and the software was Movie Player,\nthe QT player Apple includes with the software.\n\n&gt;   Don&apos;t misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.\n\nNo problem -- it still surprises me that Quicktime is able to do the\nthings it does as well as it can.\n========================================================================\nSean McMains              | Check out the Gopher    | Phone:817.565.2039\nUniversity of North Texas | New Bands Info server   | Fax  :817.565.4060\nP.O.

Everyone,\n\nBecause no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess\nmy question was not so clear. Now I\&apos;d like to describe it in detail:\n\nThe offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which\nrolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse\nand its offset is same everywhere.\n\nThis problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.\nThe tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the\npositions of the ball\&apos;s center. Is the offset of an ellipse still\nan ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial\nStandard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was\nimplemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold\ninternationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!\nHow many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most\nimportantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?\n\nI was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year\nto specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this\nproblem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)\nis not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire\nor half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from\na quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not\nanalytical. I am now wondering if I didn\&apos;t touch the base and make things\ncomplicated. Please give me a hint.\n\nI know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.\nHowever, so many people involved in the problem &quot;sphere from 4 poits&quot;.\nWhy not an ellipse? And why not its offset?\n\nPlease post here and let the others share our interests \n(I got several emails from our netters, they said they need the\nsummary of the answers).\n\nYeh\nUSC\n&apos;, &apos;From: mblock@reed.edu (Matt Block)\nSubject: Re: How to the disks copy protected.\nArticle-I.D.: reed.1993Apr20.230749.12821\nOrganization: Reed College, Portland, Oregon\nLines: 36\n\nIn article &lt;sehari.735331566@marge.ecss.iastate.edu&gt; sehari@iastate.edu (Babak Sehari) writes:\n&gt;---\n&gt;\n&gt;I was wondering, what copy protection techniques are avaliable, and how\n&gt;effective are they?

I recall, however, near monthly releases of new\nways to &quot;crack&quot; the copy protection scheme of the latest releases.  The fact\nis, none of them are completely secure, or anywhere near it.  Some are more or\nless difficult to crack, and some have already been cracked.\n\tI guess what I am saying is that your question is difficult, if not\nimpossible, to answer.  What exactly do you want to know?  Do you need a good\none for a project you are working on?  How secure must it be?  Are you trying\nto crack one that someone else has used?  I can probably make suggestions,\nassuming the activity is strictly legal.  (In general, it is a BAD idea,\nlegally, to tamper with copy protection.  It can also lead to corruption of\nfiles which you necessarily do not have back ups of (being as they are copy\nprotected,) which can be devestating.)  Do you have absolutely no ideas for\npractical applications, and are merely curious?\n\tPlease clear up those questions, and I\&apos;ll try to help as much as I\ncan.\n\n\tIncidentally, the &quot;Uh oh...&quot; at the top is indicative of the dread\nanyone who has watched their friends hacking equipment be carted off feels\nwhen they are asked how to hack.  The area you are broaching is wrought with\ndangers, many of which include breaking the law, or at least addressing it\n(from one side or the other.)\n\nMatt\n&apos;, &quot;From: kruzifix@netcom.com (Living On The Edge......)\nSubject: IMAGINE for PC??\nOrganization: Netcom - Online Communication Services (408 241-9760 guest)\nLines: 8\n\nIs Impulse shipping IMAGINE for the PC386/486?

On a typical UPS (well, on ours, anyway),\n&gt;&gt;there is NO switchover from AC to DC.  All the protected equipment is\n&gt;&gt;ALWAYS running from the batteries (via an inverter), with the usual \n&gt;&gt;condition of also having them on charge.  If the power fails, big deal - \n&gt;&gt;the computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop, but \n&gt;&gt;there\&apos;s something like 60 car-sized batteries in that cabinet, so it \n&gt;&gt;takes a while).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter,\n&gt;&gt;why not do it all the time?  Then there\&apos;d be no switchover to screw\n&gt;&gt;things up, and no having to sense the failure fast.  Just keep the DC\n&gt;&gt;on charge when the power is on, and it\&apos;ll be there in zero time when\n&gt;&gt;you &quot;need&quot; it.\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;Actually, it\&apos;s a bit more complicated than that...I sounds to me,\n&gt;your UPS takes in AC, rectifies it to DC to charge the batteries, and\n&gt;then takes the battery DC and chops it to AC again, feeding your\n&gt;equipment.  This approach is the easiest and cleanest way to\n&gt;switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since,\n&gt;as you mentioned, nothing will know about what happened down the line.\n\n&gt;Another way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until you\n&gt;lose power, and then kick in the battery backup with it\&apos;s inverter to\n&gt;replace the lost power.  The problem here is the switchover time and\n&gt;you\&apos;ve got to resync the AC in no time flat.\nThat\&apos;s a standby unit not a UPS, otherwise there would be no interuption.\nMany standby units are labled as UPS\&apos;s though.  \n \t\t\tMorgan Bullard mb4008@coewl.cen.uiuc.edu\n\t\t\t\t   or  mjbb@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n\n\n&gt;Unfortunately, most everything is built around the assumption that\n&gt;AC is available, so the UPS guys have to provide and AC output to\n&gt;be usable...ya sorta have to make it work with what there already.\n\n&gt;Similar story with our telephone system.  It was first invented back\n&gt;in the 1800\&apos;s.  We\&apos;re still using the same damn system (media) as they\n&gt;did back then.  If I have a phone from back then, I can assure you\n&gt;it\&apos;ll work on today\&apos;s phone system.  It costs too much to overhaul\n&gt;everyone to a new system, so they make it work with what is out there.\n\n&gt;.\n&apos;, &quot;From: mmanning@icomsim.com (Michael Manning)\nSubject: Re: Bikes, Contacts Lenses &amp; Radial Keratotomy\nOrganization: Icom Simulations\nLines: 22\n\nIn article &lt;C5FI2H.Ew8@rice.edu&gt;  (jcn@rice.edu) writes:\n&gt; &gt; I was going to try radial keratotomy, but they want over $2,000 per\n&gt; &gt; eye! \n&gt; &gt; That&apos;s a lot of contact lenses and sunglasses!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; And a lot of money if they make one tiny mistake ;-O\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeff Nichols\n\nAlso if they don&apos;t get it exactly right or your eyes change\nagain, contacts to correct for it are out of the question.\nThis is due to the strange conical shape your cornea takes\nafter the surgery.\n\n--\nMichael Manning\nmmanning@icomsim.com (NeXTMail accepted.)\n\n`92 FLSTF FatBoy\n`92 Ducati 900SS\n\n&quot;, &apos;From: howland@noc.arc.nasa.gov (Curt Howland)\nSubject: Re: V-max handling request\nOrganization: NASA Science Internet Project Office\nLines: 14\n\nIn article &lt;1993Apr15.222224.1@ntuvax.ntu.ac.sg&gt;, \nba7116326@ntuvax.ntu.ac.sg writes:\n|&gt; hello there\n|&gt; ican anyone who has handson experience on riding the Yamaha v-max, pls kindly\n|&gt; comment on its handling .\n\nI remember a commercial for some cheap, top-\nheavy import cage a while back, where the \ndriver says while wearing a stuck-up fake \nTV anouncers smile:\n\n&quot;It Really goes Straight!&quot;\n\nIt fits.\n&apos;, &apos;From: jeq@lachman.com (Jonathan E.

What they want\n&gt;to do is to place this thing on the Antartic ice shelf and measure the amount\n&gt;of snow fall over a period of six weeks. Every two weeks, they want to trip a\n&gt;selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the\n&gt;snow. Then by digging down into the snow, the snow fall amount can be measured\n&gt;as they come to the different color pellets.\n\n&gt;The problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold (-40 degrees)\n&gt;and a power source that wouldn&apos;t drain. I have looked at the XR-2204 timers and\n&gt;the standard NE556 dual timers, but thier temp specs won&apos;t go that low. Also,\n&gt;two weeks equates to 1,209,600 seconds per firing, which means one big timing\n&gt;cap ! I have found 2.2 farad (yes, Farad !) caps that have a working voltage of\n&gt;5 volts and are small in size. \n\nWhy are you fooling around with analog for this job?  A single chip\nmicro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily.  An 8748 only\ncosts about $5.  That and a $1 crystal and you&apos;re in business.  Embed\nthe whole thing in a foam insulated blanket, power it from a solar cell,\nuse the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely\non the insulation to hold the heat during darkness.  If you don&apos;t want\nto try thermal management, contact someone like ICL and have them cut\nyou a special low temperature crystal.  It&apos;ll cost at most $20.\n\nIf you use a single chip micro, you&apos;re looking at a parts count of \nmaybe 7.  A processor, a crystal, two caps on the crystal, a power FET\nto fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery.  This is fewer parts than \nyou can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable.  Add\na power zener diode (for heat) and a solar cell and the parts count\nscreams up to 9.\n\nPD assemblers are available for all the common single chip micros.

Question is, why channel\nTD&gt;12 and 32?\n\nThe best antenna is one that will let out the most wave (probably not the \nbest explanation, but the rest makes sense) A one wave will cancell itself \nout (BTW no such beastie) . The best is a 1/2 wave antenna, followed by \n1/4, then 1/8 etc.\n\nAs for SWRing in, what you actually do is trim the antenna to the correct \nlength for the specific wavelength you will be transmitting on. Since the \nwavelength varies with the channel you use, then it&apos;s recommended to SWR \nin using the middle channel of those you are going to use.\nAnyway in the beginning of CB&apos;s, all new antennas had to be SWR&apos;ed in, \nnowdays manufactures trim the antennas almost spot on, so that there&apos;s not \nmuch point in SWRing.

On the drawing you have a set of\n&gt;reference points whose true x,y positions are known.  \n&gt;\n&gt;Now you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using Yaron\n&gt;Danon\&apos;s excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program which\n&gt;converts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click\n&gt;the mouse.\n&gt;\n&gt;Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come\n&gt;out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways\n&gt;from the known true values.  This is understandable because the\n&gt;scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are\n&gt;successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and\n&gt;contraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process,\n&gt;scanner errors and what have you.\n&gt;\n&gt;The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so &quot;global&quot;\n&gt;adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or\n&gt;rotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.\n&gt;\n&gt;So the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for\n&gt;removing such distortion?  In particular, if I have three sets of\n&gt;points \n&gt;\n&gt;Reference(x,y) (the known true values)\n&gt;\n&gt;DistortedReference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)\n&gt;\n&gt;DistortedData(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)\n&gt;\n&gt;what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to\n&gt;DistortedData to remove the errors.\n&gt;\n&gt;I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted\n&gt;reference points as resulting from the projection of a &quot;bumpy&quot; 3d\n&gt;surface, solving for the surface and then &quot;flattening&quot; it to remove\n&gt;the errors in the other data points.\n\nIt helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least\na reasonable model of the class of distortion.  Below is a very short\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\n\n================================================================\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\n\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\n   Consider deleting these edges.\n\n1) Now, there are two goals:\n\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\&apos;s)\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \n       using the digitized (x,y)\&apos;s).\n\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\n   example:\n\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\n       Reference(x,y). \n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\n       the correct length (where &quot;correct&quot; is the DigitizedLength). \n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\n\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\n\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\nof the edges.\n\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\nobserved (essentially, you can\&apos;t allow the convex hull to change, and\nyou can\&apos;t allow triangles to &quot;fold over&quot; neighboring triangles.  Both of\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more\ncompute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having\nevery point interact with every other point....but first read up on\nlinear solutions to the n-body problem.\n\nThere are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on\nsprings, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.

So here it comes:\n\nCView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most\nannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to\ndo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control\nover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its\n&quot;current directory&quot;.  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)\nwhen it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView\ndoesn\&apos;t check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems \nto write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour\ninformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the &quot;dithering&quot;, again writing\nanother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this\nsecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does\nthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to\nyour screen again.  (It does this last &quot;recopy&quot; operation for its\n&quot;fit to screen&quot; feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)\n\n The result of this process is the following:\n  \n     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all\n        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of\n        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never\n        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren\&apos;t performed.\n\n     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for\n        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the\n        dithering and writes to the screen card.\n        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data\n        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)\n        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which\n        there was room on the disk.\n\nThis is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general\nidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details\nabout file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient\ndisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG\&apos;s (1200x900 and bigger) can be\nvery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess\nof 6 Meg free disk space.\n\n\nCView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from\na floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the\nfloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT\ntable? I can\&apos;t remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted\nfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly\nunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a\nprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files\nmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the\nhi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once\nwhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to\nsort a directory listing?\n\n\nWith much thanks to the originator of this article.\n +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+\n |        Rene Walter          |          renew@stack.urc.tue.nl           |\n +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------+\n | &quot;Will I drown in tears of sorrow, Is there hope for tomorrow,           |\n |  Will this world ever get better, Can\&apos;t we all just live together       |\n |  I don\&apos;t wanna live in strife  , I just wanna live my life              |\n |  I deserve to have a future...&quot;                                         |\n |                                     -The Good Girls    &quot;Future&quot;         |\n +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+\n\n&apos;, &quot;From: ccgwt@trentu.ca (Grant Totten)\nSubject: MS-Windows graphics viewer?\nKeywords: ms windows jpeg gif tiff \nLines: 31\nReply-To: ccgwt@trentu.ca (Grant Totten)\nOrganization: Trent University\n\n\nHowdy all,\n\n\tI was wondering if people could e-mail me their opinions on\nthe various graphics viewers available for MS-Windows 3.x...

However, expressing\n    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well\n    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far\n    exceed their technical skills.\n\n    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression\n    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and\n    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the\n    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of\n    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar\n    representions, a confounded user asks: &quot;What does it all mean?&quot;\n\n    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and\n    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by\n    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media\n    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic\n    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for\n    composing imagery for understanding.\n\n    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a\n    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the\n    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,\n    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and\n    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the\n    computer graphics context.\n\n\n    FEATURED SPEAKERS INCLUDE:\n\n        Psychology/Perception:\n            Marc De May, University of Ghent\n            Beverly J.

Can do simple display,\n  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS\n  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions\n  [PC and Macs]\n\nLabVIEW 2\n---------\n  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\n  &quot;program&quot; with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\n  instrument.\n\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\n  the development of custom code.)\n\nUltimage Concept VI\n-------------------\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\n\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\n  characterization.\n\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\n  be imported.\n\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\&apos; detection, measurement, and\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\n  modules.\n\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\n\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\n  hole filling.\n\n  The program\&apos;s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\n\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\n  707-579-1733\n\nIPLab Spectrum\n--------------\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\n\n\nMacintosh-based tools\n=====================\n\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\n---------------------------------\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\n  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,\n  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from\n  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu.

Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of\n  images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined\n  convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw\n  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also\n  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,\n  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac\n  that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version\n  from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)\n\nPhotoMac\n--------\n  Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700\n\nPhotoPress\n----------\n  Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973\n\nPixelTools and TCL-Image\n------------------------\n  &quot;Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications\n  software) for scientific image processing and analysis.

It provides a complete language for the capture, enhancement,\n  and extraction of quantitative information from gray-scale images.\n  TCL_Image has over 200 functions for image processing, and contains the\n  other elements needed in a full programming language for algorithm\n  development -- variables and control structures.  It is easily\n  extensible through &quot;script&quot; (or indirect command) files. These script\n  files are simply text files that contain TCL-Image commands.  They are\n  executed as normal commands and include the ability to pass parameters.\n  The direct capture of video images is supported via popular frame\n  grabber boards.  TCL-Image comes with the I-View utility that provides\n  conversion between common image file types, such as PICT2 and TIFF.&quot;\n\n  Perceptics 725 Pellissippi Parkway Knoxville, TN 37933 615-966-9200\n\nSatellite Image Workshop\n------------------------\n  It comes with a number of satellite pictures (raw data) and does all\n  sorts of image enhancing on it. You\&apos;ll need at least a Mac II with co-\n  processor; a 256 color display and a large harddisk. The program doesn\&apos;t\n  run under system 7.x.ATE1 V1\n\n  In the documentation the contact address is given as:  Liz Smith, Jet\n  Propulsion Laboratory, MS 300-323, 4800 Oak Grove Dr,.Pasadena, CA 91109\n  (818) 354-6980\n\nVisualization Workbench\n-----------------------\n  &quot;An electronic imaging software system that performs interactive image\n  analysis and scientific 2D and 3D plotting.&quot;\n\n  Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112\n\nAdobe Photoshop\n---------------\n\n  The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey\n  scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\n\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\n  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe\n  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,\n  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,\n  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..\n\n  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA\n  94039-7900 415-961-4400\n\nColorStudio and ImageStudio\n---------------------------\n  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has\n  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and\n  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a\n  variety of powerful selection tools including the &quot;auto selection tool&quot;\n  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close\n  hues, color range and mask.\n\nImageStudio: Don\&apos;t know...\n\n  Letraset USA 40 Eisenhower Drive Paramus, NJ 07653 201-845-6100\n\nDapple Systems\n--------------\n  &quot;High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to\n  work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of\n  global or feature parameters, and interpret the data.&quot;\n\n  Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283\n\nDigital Darkroom\n----------------\n  The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and\n  editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to\n  select part of an image simply by &quot;painting&quot; it. A new polyline\n  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide\n  selections.  A brush lets the operator &quot;paint&quot; with a selected portion\n  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.\n  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale\n  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as\n  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.\n\n  Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr.

The tool has over 80 mathematical filter\n  variations: &quot;Laplacian, medium noise filter&quot;, etc.  Files can be saved\n  as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can\&apos;t be imported).\n\n  MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109\n\nImage Analyst\n-------------\n  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative\n  data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\n  radiographs.\n\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\n  a disk-stored image.\n\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\n\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\n\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\n\nIPLab\n-----\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\n  FAX 703-281-2509\n\n  &quot;Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.&quot;\n\nMAP II\n------\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\n  integrated image analysis.\n\nIMAGE\n-----\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\n  image v3.\n\n\n\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\n==========================\n\nCCD\n---\n  Richard Berry\&apos;s CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\n  disks with image manipulating software.

Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,\n  or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)\n  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),\n  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building\n  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.\n     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is\n  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy\n  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a\n  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything\n  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.\n  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based\n  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware\n  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and\n  can do image arithmetic, etc.\n    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is\n  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and\n  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.\n     There is currently a project - &quot;AIPS++&quot; - underway to rewrite the\n  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an\n  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for\n  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be\n  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with\n  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and\n  Australia to name a few. \n\nLABOimage\n---------\n  (version 4.0 is out for X11) It\&apos;s written in C, and currently\n  runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.\n  The expert system for image segmentation is written in Allegro Common Lisp.\n  It was used on the following domains: computer science (image analysis), \n  medicine, biology, physics.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\n  modules.\n\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\n  ratioing.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\&apos;s environments. Using\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\n  applications programs.\n\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\n  interactively driven through this control.\n\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\n\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\n  processing of remote sensed data.\n\n  For further information, please contact:\n\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

Select a chunk of five band data from a pass,\n  automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to\n  byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically\n  and carefree.\n\n  It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn\&apos;t that\n  difficult to write your own with their programmer\&apos;s module.\n\n  Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. Been around for\n  a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000\n  with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display&quot;\n\nHIPS\n----\n(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory\&apos;s Image Processing System)\n\n  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image\n  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image\n  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil\n  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\n\n  Feature description\n\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\n\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\n\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\n  ``filters\&apos;\&apos;.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\n\n  Availability\n\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\n\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\n\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \n  palettes can be generated.\n\n\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\n\no  image &amp; image: + - / * interpolation\no  image &amp; constant: + - / *\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short-&gt;real or real-&gt;short.\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

If you want a light that goes on when \n&gt;: the &apos;phone is *Off* hook, all you need it to run it in *series* with the \n&gt;: line, as I mentioned in my previous post.  If you want a light that goes on \n&gt;: when the &apos;phone is *on* hook, all you need is a voltage threshold detector.\n&gt;\n&gt;If you&apos;re going to do the series Diode thing (which is the easiest), just\n&gt;make sure that the LED can take the current (I can&apos;t recall it off-hand, but\n&gt;it&apos;s something like 100mA or more?)\n\nCareful now folks... Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ring\nand tip when the phone&apos;s supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zener\nand LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.  Whatever\nscheme you use, make sure you&apos;ve got at least 200V-rated components on \nthe frontend.\n\nAlso remember that, if I&apos;m not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohm\nequivalent circuit.  Any current you draw from the 48V or so gets\ndropped across that 600ohms.  That&apos;s fine until you&apos;re down to roughly\n12V, when Ma Bell considers it to be off-hook.  But dropping it that\nfar down is probably a big no-no.\n\nThe easiest implementation to accomplish the above??\n\n    tip  -------&gt;|-----\\/\\/\\/\\-----+----------+\n              rectifier  resistor  |          |\n              diode                |          \\ \n                                   V          /\n                          zener  /---/        \\  resistor\n                                   |          /\n                                   |          |\n                                   |          V   LED\n                                   |         ---\n                                   |          |\n    ring --------------------------+----------+\n\nThis is only a suggestion...go ahead and blow holes in it, but you\nget the idea.

The long answer is yes - but a\nfew have had a few problems with their platforms - not all unix\&apos;s are\nthe same, you know! As far as &quot;many bugs&quot; go, it would probably be more\nuseful to everyone (including you) if you were a bit more explicit! :-)\n\nPlatforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are: RS6000, Dec Ultrix\nSun Solaris so it is possible.\n\nThe main problem is that I don\&apos;t have access to other platforms than the\nRS6000, so if there are portability problems then the only way I hear\nabout them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to\nhow to fix it.\n\nAs far as the software not doing anything, do you really think I would\nbother releasing it, if that was the case?

When you run this program, you will enter \&apos;read\&apos; menu. Whthin this\n      menu you can press any function key except F5. If you move or copy\n      files, you will enter \&apos;write\&apos; menu. the \&apos;write\&apos; menu is much like\n      \&apos;read\&apos; menu, but only allow you to change directory.\n+       The header line in \&apos;read\&apos; menu includes &quot;(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)&quot;.\n+         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.\n      pressing SPACE in \&apos;read\&apos; menu will let you select which format to use\n        for reading current file.\n      pressing RETURN in \&apos;read\&apos; menu will let you reading current file. This\n        program will automatically determine which format this file is.\n        The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check\n        standard extension. Still fail, report error.\n      pressing s or S in \&apos;read\&apos; menu will do \&apos;Slide Show\&apos;.\n        If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key\n          (except ESCAPE).\n        If any error occurs, program will make a beep.\n        ESCAPE to terminate.\n      pressing Ins in \&apos;read\&apos; menu will change display type.\n      pressing ALT-X in \&apos;read\&apos; menu will quit program without prompting.\n\n   2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter \&apos;screen\&apos; menu.\n      Within this menu F5 is turn on. You can do special effect on image.\n      pressing RETURN: show image.\n        in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text\n        mode.\n      pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do\n        special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.\n      pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.\n      pressing SPACE: save current image to file.\n        B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).\n        Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).\n        Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).\n        True Color: save as 24-bit image.\n\n        This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image\n        to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program\n        will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another\n        directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after\n        pressing SPACE, you will enter \&apos;write2\&apos; menu. You can change\n        directory to what you want. Then,\n\n        pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you \&apos;original\&apos; filename.\n        pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you \&apos;selected\&apos; filename\n                      (filename under bar).\n\n\n  3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.\n\n  4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don\&apos;t have enough memory,\n     the performance is poor.\n\n  5. If you want to save 8 bits image :\n       try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...\n\n     If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):\n       try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster\n       (No one is better for true 24bits image)\n\n  6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.\n\n  7. Not all subroutines are fully tested\n\n  8. This document is not well written.

I guess\n&gt;there is some gas compression that may affect the amount pushed out\n&gt;but the limiting factor seems to be the header pipe and not the \n&gt;canister.  Meaning: would gases &quot;so far&quot; down the line (the canister)\n&gt;really have an effect on the exhaust stroke?  Do the gases really \n&gt;compress that much?\n\n    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses\nin the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.\n\n1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\ndoes the pressure ever become &quot;negative&quot;, or even approach a good\nvacuum.\n\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\ndifference and the products of combustion.\n\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\n\n4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.\nIf free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference\nwas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.\n\n5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any\ngiven RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it\non the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.\nPumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| Dave Tharp                      | DoD #0751   | &quot;You can\&apos;t wear out       |\n| davet@interceptor.CDS.TEK.COM   | MRA #151    |   an Indian Scout,        |\n| \&apos;88 K75S  \&apos;48 Indian Chief      | AHRMA #751  |  Or its brother the Chief.|\n| \&apos;75 R90S(#151) \&apos;72 TR-2B(#751)  | AMA #524737 |  They\&apos;re built like rocks |\n| \&apos;65 R50/2/Velorex  \&apos;57 NSU Max  |             |   to take the knocks,     |\n|       1936 BMW R12              | (Compulsive | It\&apos;s the Harleys that     |\n| My employer has no idea.        |   Joiner)   |   give you grief.&quot;        |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&apos;, &quot;From: csundh30@ursa.calvin.edu (Charles Sundheim)\nSubject: Re: story \nKeywords: PARTY!!!!\nNntp-Posting-Host: ursa\nOrganization: Calvin College\nLines: 12\n\nlynn@pacesetter.com (Lynn E.

The \ncopier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured the\nprinter with the &quot;lp&quot; system using the parallel interface and can print \npostscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files, but these are in \nturn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a \npublication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts \nare less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of \nprograms, such as showcase, xv, and tops.  When we convert to postscript \nwith tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98 \nrather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that \nacceptable.  Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format\nand translating the image into postscript.\n\nWe suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality \npictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the \nSCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a \nwarranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without \nsome assurance that the product will work.\n\n\nHere my questions:\n\nIf anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or \nparallel port?  What is the quality of the printouts?\n\nIs there a way to create high quality postscript printouts?

Why would the picture tube explode or even smoke?\n&gt; I still have the left over TV set, I might dig into it this summer. Any\n&gt;idea where I can get parts for these things?

I\&apos;d think the TV mfrs want\nto make this possibility remote as possible.

In any\ncase, don\&apos;t kick it around! :-) \n\n#2  I fixed the TV after getting a hold of some schematics.  It turned\nout to be a blown 2W resistor feeding the flyback transformer.

It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only\nat that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the\nwhole design should be changed to support 24bit images.\nThat were not done and now we have\n -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)\n -the program has human interface errors.\n\nOtherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without\nclearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.\n\n[ ..deleted.. ]\n\n==clip==\n\nSome new items follows.\n\n==clip==\n\nI have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24\noption than with default option we have.\nThe reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)\nthe same than used in ppmquant.\n\nIf you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found\nthat rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv\n(our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly\n-- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.\n\nI don&apos;t know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no.\nSo, use of XV&apos;s -best24 option is not very good idea.\n\nI suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in\nrlequant -- I&apos;m sure rle-people gives permission.\n(Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so I\ncan say nothing about it.)\n\n==clip==\n\n==clip==\n\nSome minor bugs in human interface are:\n\nKey pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happens\nthat I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong\nplace. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about\nfive minutes and then it is gone away immediately.\nThe buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.\n\nAlso, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard\nand mouse for XV after the image is completed.\nOften it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when\nI&apos;m writing something with editor or such. Those key pressings\nthen go to XV and image has gone or something weird.\n\nIn the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV\nupdates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values first\nand then get the updated image. It is annoying wait image to be\nupdated when the setting are not ready yet.\nI suggest of adding an &apos;apply&apos; button to update the exchanges done.\n\n==clip==\n&quot;, &apos;From: krouth@slee01.srl.ford.com (Kevin Routh)\nSubject: F.Y.I.: ImageWriter to Windows...\nOrganization: Ford Motor Company Research Laboratory\nLines: 53\nNNTP-Posting-Host: slee01.srl.ford.com\nX-Newsreader: Tin 1.1 PL5\n\n[ Article crossposted from comp.windows.ms ]\n[ Author was Kevin Routh ]\n[ Posted on 19 Apr 1993 12:35:55 GMT ]\n\nFor your information:\n\nI hooked up my ImageWriter I to my COM1 serial port and used the C-Itoh\n8510 driver in Windows 3.1.

They look like cylinders\n&gt; &gt;that have been pinched in the middle. Does anybody know what the\n&gt; &gt;actual purpose of those things are?. I hear that they\&apos;re called\n&gt; &gt;\&apos;Cooling Towers\&apos; but what the heck do they cool?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Except for their size, the cooling towers on nuclear power plants\n&gt; are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling\n&gt; towers designed and built in the 1890\&apos;s (a hundred years ago) for\n&gt; coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Basicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when\n&gt; its air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network\n&gt; of pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist cooling\n&gt; and the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the\n&gt; hot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than\n&gt; just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is\n&gt; rapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently\n&gt; seen rising out of these towers.\n&gt;  \n&gt; That slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because\n&gt; it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of\n&gt; the air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam\n&gt; system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the\n&gt; boiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across\n&gt; the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and\n&gt; by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it\n&gt; back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference\n&gt; (sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage &quot;hot&quot;\n&gt; turbine to final stage &quot;cold&quot; turbine).\n&gt;  \n&gt;                                         R.

I was doing\n&gt;&gt;most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and\n&gt;&gt;nothing seemed to get rid of the clicks.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;My question is:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\tIs there a good relay/relay circuit that I can use for switching\n&gt;&gt;audio, so that there will be *NO* noise of any kind on the audio lines.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I will appreciate any advice or references to advice.  Also, exact part\n&gt;&gt;numbers/company names etc. for the relays will help!\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you switching high level signals or low level signals like pre-amp\n&gt; out level signals?  Also, are the clicks you mentioning the big\n&gt; clack that happens when it switches or are you refering to contact\n&gt; bounce?  How are you driving the relays?  TTL gate output?  Switching\n&gt; transistor?  How are the relays connected to what you are driving?\n&gt; \n&gt; Need more specifics to answer your question!! :-)\n\nAs a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer\nthe circuit with the contacts.  The noise you hear is due to the momentary\nopening and closing of the path.\n\nThe noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high\nimpedance audio circuits a resistive &quot;T&quot; is constructed close to characteristic\nimpedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers\nthe audio.\n\nIn low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are\nshorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic\nimpedance.\n\nSometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used\nto momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.\n\nTelephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to &quot;Make before\nbreak and Vica Versa&quot; but I haven\&apos;t seen any of these for years.\n\nNowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.\n\nA novel circuit I used to build was a primitive &quot;optical isolator&quot;.. It consists\nof a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is\noff the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers\npassing the audio.  Once again this device in a &quot;T&quot; switches the audio.  Varying\nthe lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and\nyou have a mixer!\n\nLots of luck!\n-- \n73, Tom\n================================================================================\nTom Wagner, Audio Visual Technician.

My school has some beauutful 100Mhz HP that are digital with\n|&gt; all the bells and whistles, including soft-keys, which I think are a\n|&gt; loveley touch. ( that is, software keys. ) You don\&apos;t forget that you\n|&gt; are dealing with a computer. Those scopes even with all their\n|&gt; neatness, still make the ickyest looking waves. Lotsa features, but\n|&gt; ugly output. And those are the best digitals I have ever seen. I\&apos;ve\n|&gt; seen a lot of cheaper digitals and they look terrible.\n\nI think the hangup with digital scopes is that you have to know so much\nmore about them and how they work on a scope-by-scope basis, and\nsome of the functions are typically presented, in my opinion,\nin a counter-intuitive fashion (HP has made some strides in their\n54600 series, IMO). Automatic setups are fine for simple,\nrepetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more\ncomplex events where you need to understand how the scope is\nactually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope\nin &quot;equivalent time&quot; or in &quot;real time&quot; sampling mode (equivalent time\nbeing a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to\nthe trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope\&apos;s actual sampling\nrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but\nbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.\n\nIs the HP scope you\&apos;re using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz\nsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front\nend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for\nequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really\nonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single\nsample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.\n\nSo, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get\nuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for\ngeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage for\nlater analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability\nof the scope.

Books have been written on that! But in regard to\nAeroStich it really depends on your particular size, shape and needs.\nIf you upper and lower body are not proportional (according to aero\ndimensions) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching\nthe 2 piece suit. I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it.\nHaving my life quota of scars from crashing off road, I am very\nconcerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in\nprotection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. I\nthink the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a\ndifference. One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go\nsomewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket)\nyou can just detach and stow the pants. \n\nOne thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for\nmany women (with standard suits). Supposedly for smaller women (and\npetite men for that matter) the 1 piece will fit better. \n\nAnother recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them. I wish I\ngot 2-3 inches added to my pant legs. I find the Long suits are not\nreally that long (I can\&apos;t imagine how short the standard suits must\nbe). \n\n--\nJonathan E.

The first one is Ray (or half line) method. In\nthis method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point\nof the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd,\nthen it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which\nmay make you headache.\n\nThe second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and\nall the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the\nsuccessive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, then\nit is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside.\n\nMy experience tells the second method is relible.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nYeh\nUSC\n&apos;, &apos;From: dagibbs@quantum.qnx.com (David Gibbs)\nSubject: Re: Wanted: Advice for New Cylist\nOrganization: QNX Software Systems, Ltd.\nLines: 73\n\nIn article &lt;C5r7Ey.7Mq@srgenprp.sr.hp.com&gt; blaisec@sr.hp.com (Blaise Cirelli) writes:\n&gt;\n&gt;So the question I have is &quot;HOW DANGEROUS IS RIDING&quot;?            \n\nTough question -- more dangerous than driving a car, and far more\ndangerous if you don\&apos;t apply a modicum of intelligence to the \nactivity.  Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot\nfaster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is\nnot unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective\nclothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong,\nyou are likely to be less severely injured.\n\nFirst thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course,\nthis will get you started on the right foot -- they teach\ncontrol of the vehicle and safe riding practices.\n\nSecond, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet\nand a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy \npiece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking\nboots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine\nfor this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay \ntied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps\nare nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the\npants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable,\npreferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for\na jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though\nmore people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another\nthing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand\nleather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.\n\nThird don\&apos;t do anything stupid -- don\&apos;t ride after \ndrinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement\nand balance; don\&apos;t ride in the snow, or when conditions\nare such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding\nin the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly, \nbrake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick,\ntired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or\notherwise not in average shape.\n\nWith care, you should be ok.\n\n&gt;The next question I have is what bike would you recommend for\n&gt;a first time rider. I don\&apos;t want to race; nor do I want to\n&gt;ride cross country; nor do I want to ride on dirt trails. I\&apos;ll\n&gt;probably drive it on back roads with occasional rides on city\n&gt;streets and freeways. The maximum I can spend is about $2500 so\n&gt;I\&apos;ll be looking at a used bike.\n\nI would suggest mid to late 80\&apos;s japanese mid-sized standard.\nSomething in 400-650 cc range would probably be reasonable.  If\nyou are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go as\nlow as a 300-400 cc bike.\n\nPossible models: \nThe Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generally\ninline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to \nweakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier \nproblems.)  My first bike was a (about \&apos;82) GS650, it server me well.\n\nThe Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### series\nI think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series of\nstandard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.\n\nKawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don\&apos;t know\nthem as well.\n\nFor mid to late \&apos;80s models of the above, you should be able to\nbuy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective \nclothing and insurance and licensing costs.\n\nHope this helps,\n-David\n(dagibbs@qnx.com)\n&apos;, &apos;From: bailey@vader.egr.uri.edu (Scott Bailey)\nSubject: Re: Jacob\&apos;s Ladder\nSummary: Jacob\&apos;s Ladder and other projects\nKeywords: jacob\&apos;s ladder,projects,book\nOrganization: University of Rhode Island / College of Engineering\nLines: 30\n\nHi all,\n I\&apos;ve been following this thread about jacob\&apos;s ladder for a few weeks and I\nhappened to come across one of the best project books that I\&apos;ve seen in a \nwhile.

The line passing through this center\nperpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of\nthe sphere.\n\n3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points.

Basically, you look into a room that looks\nsimilar to the following:\n\n                             xxxx\n                         xxxxx   xxxx\n                     xxxx    x       xxxx\n                 xxxx        x           xxxx\n             xxxx     2      xxxx     1      xxxx\n             x           xxxx    xxxx           x\n             x       xxxx            xxxx       x\n             x   xxxx             o      xxxx   x\n             xxxx              3 /|\\         xxxx\n                 xxxx            /~\\     xxxx\n                     xxxx            xxxx\n                         xxxx    xxxx\n                             xxxx\n\nThe good thing about this perspective is that you can look and move\naround in three dimensions and still maintain your peripheral vision. [*]\n\nSince your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded\nfor a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two\&apos;s rising edge has a slope\nof 1/4. (I\&apos;m also using Mode X, 320x240).\n\nI\&apos;ve run into two problems; I\&apos;m sure that other readers have tried this\nbefore, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:\n\n1) The routines for drawing walls 1 &amp; 2 were trivial, but when I ran a\npacked-&gt;planar image through them, I was dismayed by the &quot;jaggies.&quot;  I\&apos;m\nnow considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary).\nIs it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed,\nthus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?\n\n2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort\nthe original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.\nHas anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared\nshape?\n\nCurrently I take:\n\n  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32\n 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48\n 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\n\nand produce:\n            \n             1  2  3  4\n33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8\n49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12\n            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16\n                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32\n                                    61 62 63 64\n\nLine 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1.\nLine 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3.\nThis fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  But\nit causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way?\nPerhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap\nalready skewed?\n\nAre there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective?\nI was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering.\nLocations are stored in (x,y,z) form.\n\n[*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1)\n*are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears to\nbe an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside\nof a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points.\nThis simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don\&apos;t have to\nchange size as they move about in the room).  I\&apos;ve decided that this\napproximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough\ndistance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in\na real perspective drawing.\n\nHopefully the &quot;context&quot; of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches\nhanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.\n\nThanks in advance for any help.\n\n-- \nTill next time,                \\o/   \\o/\n                                V \\o/ V     email:pinky@tamu.edu\n&lt;&gt;  Sam  Inala  &lt;&gt;                 V\n\n&apos;, &quot;From: ccgwt@trentu.ca (Grant Totten)\nSubject: Re: MS-Windows Screen Grabber (summary)\nLines: 28\nReply-To: ccgwt@trentu.ca (Grant Totten)\nOrganization: Trent University\n\n\nHi again,\n\nMany thanks to all the people who responded to my request for a MS-\nWindows screen grabber.

Sometimes, this will be a reference\npower, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which\nshould also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms\nin an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted\nnotation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of\nthe circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*\n(rather than reference power).

I don&apos;t know anyone that&apos;s been crucified for messing it up.\n\nCommon references for audio are:\n\n\t0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms\n\t0 dBV = 1 volt\n\n\t0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)\n\t0 VU = -10dBV\t(consumer gear line level)\n\n\nOften times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using\nthe rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all\ndone to whatever reference is reasonable for the application\nor moment.\n\nNote that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear\nimpedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the\npower will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done\nwith the above two identities and ohm&apos;s law.\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 \t\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\t\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\n\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)\n&quot;, &apos;From: mogal@deadhead.asd.sgi.com (Joshua Mogal)\nSubject: Re: SGI sales practices (Was: Crimson (Was: Kubota Announcement?))\nOrganization: Silicon Graphics, Inc.\nLines: 123\nNNTP-Posting-Host: deadhead.asd.sgi.com\n\n|&gt; My\n|&gt; comment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other\n|&gt; vendors\n|&gt; that supported OpenGL, rather than deal further with SGI.\n\nOpenGL is a graphics programming library and as such is a great, portable\ninterface for the development of interactive 3D graphics applications. It\nis not, however, an indicator of performance, as that will vary strongly\nfrom machine to machine and vendor to vendor.  SGI is committed to high\nperformance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so OpenGL\nmeans that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms, there is no\nguarantee that your performance would be comparable.\n\n|&gt; \n|&gt; What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that\n|&gt; we *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the\n|&gt; Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.\n\nIf your sales representative truly mislead you, then you should have a\nvalid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGI\nsales management team. Feel free to contact the local branch manager...we\nunderstand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers, so give it a\nshot.\n\n|&gt; \n|&gt; I\&apos;m also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at a\n|&gt; previous site on the understanding *that* architecture would be around\n|&gt; for a while, rather than being flushed.\n\nAs one of the previous posts stated, the Personal IRIS was introduced in\n1988 and grew to include the 4D/20, 4D/25, 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rates\nsped up over time. As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5\nyears. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series (\&apos;85-\&apos;89), the PI\n(\&apos;88-\&apos;93), the Professional Series (the early 4D\&apos;s - \&apos;86-\&apos;90), the Power\nSeries parallel systems (\&apos;88-\&apos;93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a\nparticular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics\narchitectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every\n18 months to 2 years.\n\nThese are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become\nalmost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new\nplatform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths,\nfaster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If we\ndon\&apos;t, we become uncompetitive.\n\nFrom the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your\ncurrent needs and makes economic sense today.  You can\&apos;t wait to buy, but\nif you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep\nfor one in writing. If it\&apos;s feasible, they should be able to do that. Some\nof our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as\nthe Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series\nmultiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain\na guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge\nR4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.\n\n|&gt; \n|&gt; Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to\n|&gt; keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself\n|&gt; pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books\n|&gt; just before the end of the quarter), but I\&apos;m just a little tired of\n|&gt; getting boned in the process.\n|&gt; \n\nIf that\&apos;s happening, it\&apos;s becausing of misunderstandings or\nmis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our\ncustomer base.\n\n|&gt; Maybe it\&apos;s because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we\n|&gt; aren\&apos;t entitled to a &quot;peek under the covers&quot; as the Big Kids (NASA,\n|&gt; for instance) are.  This lab, and I suspect that a lot of other labs\n|&gt; and organizations, doesn\&apos;t have a load of money to spend on computers\n|&gt; every year, so we can\&apos;t be out buying new systems on a regular basis.\n\nMost SGI customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give a\ngreat deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because\nagain, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the schedule\nslipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were\ncounting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and\nwould also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial\nanalysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our\ncommitments.\n\n|&gt; The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the\n|&gt; entire grant period of five years and, in some case, beyond. That\n|&gt; means that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I\n|&gt; have the money, not some product that was built, to paraphrase one\n|&gt; previous poster\&apos;s words, \&apos;to fill a niche\&apos; to compete with some other\n|&gt; vendor.  I\&apos;m going to be looking at this box for the next five years.\n|&gt; And every time I look at it, I\&apos;m going to think about SGI and how I\n|&gt; could have better spent my money (actually *your* money, since we\&apos;re\n|&gt; supported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars).\n|&gt; \n\nFive years is an awfully long time in computer years. New processor\ntechnologies are arriving every 1-2 years, making a 5 year old computer at\nleast 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. The competitive nature\nof the market is demanding that rate of development, so if your timing is\nreally 5 years between purchases, you have to accept the limited viability\nof whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor.\n\nThere are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live\nwith, but keeping customers happy is the most important, so don\&apos;t give up,\nwe know it.\n\nJosh   |:-)\n\n-- \n\n\n**************************************************************************\n**\t\t\t\t     **\t\t\t\t\t**\n**\tJoshua Mogal\t\t     **\tProduct Manager\t\t\t**\n**\tAdvanced Graphics Division   **\t  Advanced Graphics Systems\t**\n**\tSilicon Graphics Inc.\t     **\tMarket Manager\t\t\t**\n**\t2011 North Shoreline Blvd.   **\t  Virtual Reality\t\t**\n**\tMountain View, CA 94039-7311 **\t  Interactive Entertainment\t**\n**\tM/S 9L-580\t\t     **\t\t\t\t\t**\n**\t\t\t\t     *************************************\n**\tTel:\t(415) 390-1460\t\t\t\t\t\t**\n**\tFax:\t(415) 964-8671\t\t\t\t\t\t**\n**\tE-mail:\tmogal@sgi.com\t\t\t\t\t\t**\n**\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t**\n**************************************************************************\n&apos;, &quot;From: howland@noc2.arc.nasa.gov (Curt Howland)\nSubject: Re: Auction: Diana&apos;s bra\nOrganization: NASA Science Internet Project Office\nLines: 13\n\nIn article &lt;1993Apr2.163531.12974@adobe.com&gt;, \ncjackson@adobe.com (Curtis Jackson) writes:\n\n|&gt; Next thing you know I&apos;ll see bikes with Geeky stickers parked\n|&gt; outside the local white wine, quiche, and fern bar.\n\nHey!

Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.\n\nGrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-\nline/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.\n\nGrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel\nprojections (If you can&apos;t understand a word, don&apos;t worry, this is just showing\noff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain\nwhat it all means later on). \n\nGrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with\ndata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines\nto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so\nyou don&apos;t have to worry about that if you don&apos;t want to)\n\nGrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above \nprocessors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.\nBoth versions are *100% source compatibel*. \n\nGrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D\ngraphics and how to use the package.\n\nIf demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. \nHowever, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for\na lot more people than the select &apos;OOP-Guild&apos;.\n\nGrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage.

Anyone else feel this way?\n&gt;  CH&gt; Just curious.\n&gt;\n&gt;I must agree.  There is a dizzying number of c.s.amiga.* newsgroups\n&gt;already.

I forget exactly how wide the poly\n\tlines were.  If I were doing this design again, I&apos;d probably\n\tomit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead,\n\tusing just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a high\n\tresistance it can be ignored at these speeds).\n\n4) You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with\n\tslightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially for\n\toutput signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors.\n\tI had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for\n\ta MOSIS tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as I\n\tneeded. \n\nKevin Karplus\n-- \nKevin Karplus\t\tkarplus@ce.ucsc.edu\n\nDue to budgetary constraints the light at the end of the tunnel is\nbeing turned off.\n&quot;, &apos;From: heinboke@tnt.uni-hannover.de (Andreas Heinbokel)\nSubject: LOOKING for AD PC-Board\nReply-To: heinboke@tnt.uni-hannover.de\nOrganization: Universitaet Hannover, Theoretische Nachrichtentechnik\nLines: 41\n\nThis is for a friend of mine.

Yes, the helmet did its job.  But the damage/impact\n&gt;ratio was scary.  I own Bell Moto-5 now, have taken impacts on\n&gt;order of twice the Bieffe impact (we do this frequently in MX),\n&gt;and don&apos;t even have a scratch on it after two seasons.  My\n&gt;recommendation is to buy _high_ quality gear.  YMMV.\n\nWhen your helmetted nogin hits an immoveabe object, there are only four things\nto dissipate the energy: the immoveable object, the helmet shell, the helmet\nliner, the rider&apos;s head, the rider&apos;s ego (ok, five). Assuming that the helmet/\nhead assembly takes the same impact, if the shell cracks in one case, then in\nthe other the liner must be dented, or the head gets jiggled. If it&apos;s the\nthe liner that&apos;s dented, the helmet is just as toast as if the shell were\ncracked, it won&apos;t absorb energy form an impact in that area. If it&apos;s the head\nthat&apos;s getting jiggled, maybe the new gear isn&apos;t of as high quality after all?\n\nI&apos;ve        bike                      like       | Jody Levine  DoD #275 kV\n     got a       you can        if you      -PF  | Jody.P.Levine@hydro.on.ca\n                         ride it                 | Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n&quot;, &quot;Subject: Re: Protective gear\nFrom: bclarke@galaxy.gov.bc.ca\nOrganization: BC Systems Corporation\nLines: 14\n\nIn article &lt;734055654snz@morgan.demon.co.uk&gt;, tony@morgan.demon.co.uk (Tony Kidson) writes:\n&gt; In article &lt;1993Apr5.151323.7183@rd.hydro.on.ca&gt; jlevine@rd.hydro.on.ca writes:\n&gt;&gt;In article &lt;C4wKFs.BC1@eskimo.com&gt; maven@eskimo.com (Norman Hamer) writes:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;What protective gear is the most important?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I would go for the gloves.

It is the protection \n&gt; &gt;that they use on the video tapes.  There are two ways around this that I \n&gt; &gt;know of.  First of all, you can try using a different VCR to copy onto.\n&gt; &gt;It is the input of the VCR that reacts to the protection so sometimes \n&gt; &gt;just switching the two VCRs around will take care of it.  Some models \n&gt; &gt;just don&apos;t react to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does this also affect the viewing of tapes ? I have had problems with\n&gt; a couple of rented tapes; they were virtually unviewable. I fiddled \n&gt; with the tuning, tracking and vertical hold but it was no good.\n&gt; \n\n\nIt sounds like your TV is one of the ones that also reacts to the video \nprotection.  (Poor you!)\n\nThe Macroscrubber from Radio Electronics removes the protection so you \nsouldn&apos;t have any more problems.  However, if you use the method of \ncopying it from one VCR to another where the second VCR doesn&apos;t react to \nthe protection, you will end up with a duplicate tape, including the \nprotection.\n\nOne thought comes to mind about your problem...  When playing the tape \nfor viewing, are you feeding the signal from the source VCR through an \nextra device before going to the TV?  If you feed it through a second VCR \nfirst, that is your problem.  As to other devices such as converters, I \ndon&apos;t know if they would react or not.  Just to be safe, you might want \nto make sure that you have NOTHING between the VCR and TV.\n\nvictor@inqmind.bison.mb.ca\nThe Inquiring Mind BBS, Winnipeg, Manitoba  204 488-1607\n&quot;, &quot;From: cantrell@sauron.msfc.nasa.gov (Eric Cantrell)\nSubject: EEG Kit?\nNntp-Posting-Host: sauron.msfc.nasa.gov\nOrganization: NASA/MSFC\nX-Newsreader: NN version 6.4.19\nLines: 9\n\nAwhile back someone posted some information on where you can get\nkits to build an EEG.

I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage. \nMy bike is a Kawasaki GPX250R with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such\nthat they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc., and on the\nlower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a &quot;bank-follower&quot;, or a\nlittle stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a\n100%-banked turn.  The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 7\nmm long, which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg.  Now for the\nmystery.\n\nThe stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent.  I\&apos;m\nfairly sure it was there before the event.  There was no damage to the end of\nthe footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been.  In fact, the thread in\nthe hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact, with no evidence of something\nhaving been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously.  \n\nOkay all you engineering types, how the f**k do you explain this ?

Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingo\nthat Kawasaki never mentioned, like that the end of the footpeg suddenly\nchanges phase on impact, to let the stud rip out, then changes back to a solid\n?

Often when some scumbag steals the cover, that means\n&gt;   that they were or are looking to steal the bike.  In my case, I\n&gt;   had a faded cover stolen off a bmw R100RS that was stashed in an\n&gt;   apartment carport and not visible from the street.  They evidently\n&gt;   decided the beemer wasn\&apos;t worth stealing, but did try the next night to\n&gt;   steal a Honda Hurricane 600 parked in the next apartment building.\n&gt;   A neighbor heard them wheeling it out and called the cops.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I know this is just setting myself up, but this is actually one of the\n&gt;things that is really good about BMW bikes.  From all accounts I\&apos;ve\n&gt;heard practically no one steals BMWs. Probably it is similar for Moto\n&gt;Guzzis and other relative &quot;exotics&quot; since there isn\&apos;t a large demand\n&gt;for parts and the bike would be much easier to track down. It seems\n&gt;that the most stolen bikes are Harleys and 600cc Jap sport bikes. \n\nWell, I\&apos;d say you\&apos;re mostly right, but for different reasons. (BTW, as of a\ncouple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750\nGSX\&apos;s and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren\&apos;t ripped off is that\nmost people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail-\norder types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily\nby law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep \nthem honest about acquiring parts. \n\nFor Harleys and rice-rockets, you\&apos;ve got 2 different situations. There is a\nHUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily.\nDitto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these are\nnot as high, comparatively. For the \&apos;rockets\&apos;, anytime a bike goes down, the \nplastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It\&apos;s fairly easy,\nthen, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap it\non a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. The other parts,\nmore traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable.\n\nMike\n-- \nDisclaimer - These opiini^H^H damn! ^H^H ^Q ^[ .... :w  :q  :wq  :wq! ^d  ^X ^?\nexit X Q  ^C ^? :quitbye  CtrlAltDel   ~~q  :~q  logout  save/quit :!QUIT\n^[zz ^[ZZZZZZ ^vi  man vi ^@  ^L  ^[c  ^# ^E ^X ^I ^T ? help  helpquit ^D  ^d !!\nman help ^C ^c :e! help exit ?Quit ?q CtrlShftDel &quot;Hey, what does Stop L1A d...&quot;\n&apos;, &quot;From: jmichael@vnet.IBM.COM\nSubject: Radar Detector DETECTORS?\nArticle-I.D.: almaden.19930406.131941.134\nLines: 3\n\n\nThey detect the oscillator operating in the detector.

If it&apos;s a choice\nbetween injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is\nonly one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put\nthe dog first.\n\nSecond, it&apos;s useful to learn how to read a dog&apos;s body language.  How you react\nto a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it&apos;s a game (and that you&apos;re\nplaying with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which\nhas hostile intent.\n\nThird, it&apos;s useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social\nbeasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are\ntwo types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which\ndominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the\nlatter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible.\nBut God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may\neven on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh\nrapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!\n\nNow, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it&apos;s a good idea to\nassume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it&apos;s a\ngame, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one;\nwhen you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of\ninterception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so\nthat when he reaches it you&apos;re already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to\nreact to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a\nmotorcycle is capable of.\n\nWith a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures\nmay be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important\n-- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the\nroad, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up\nnewspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will\nhurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is\nthat you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The\nlarger the dog, the greater your anger.\n\nDogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he\nare not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he\nis on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.\n\nMost dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory\nwhere there is at least a home advantage.  They&apos;ll also observe that you are\nsatisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped\npunishment.\n\nThe interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great\ndeal to them.  The more effective you are at communicating body language, the\nless you actually have to do.

Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats\nas well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.\n\n\t\t    Image Analysis &amp; Processing\n\n\tFor image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes an\nassortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and \nmathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution \nproduct or principal component analyses.\nAn interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows\nthe user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively.\nStandard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig\nonometric and transcendental functions.\n\n\t\t    Satellite Spectra &amp; Orbit Analysis\n\n\tSphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity\nfor various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.).\nThe simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and\nsurface conditions and instrument spectral bands.\nA geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation,\nand 3-D image projection.\n\n\t\t    Easy External Program Interfacing\n\n\tSphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally\ndeveloped software algorithms for processing and converting satellite\nobservations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters\nto external programs using special interface functions.\n\n\t\t    Quick Quality Presentation\n\n\tSphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution\nmultispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image\nplanes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images,\ngraphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports.\nSphinx\&apos;s 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying\nand integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as \nhistograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale\noutput for standard inkjet and laser printers.\n\tOther Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external \ngraphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?\n\n\t\t    Software Support &amp; Development\n\n\t Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d\&apos;Optique Atmospherique (LOA)\n of the Universite de Lille, France.\nThe package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at\nthe French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),\nand the French space agency, Centre National d\&apos;Etudes Spatiales (CNES).\nAt LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing\nresearch needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which features\non-line help, is supported by an Internet address\n\n sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and\n version updates provided without delay.\n\n\t\t    Performance Tested\n\n \tCNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data \ncollected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.  Today,\nthe Sphinx package is in use at the NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center\nand is widely used in many French laboratories, including\nthe Centre de Recherche en Physique de l\&apos;Environnement, Ecole Normale Superieure ,\nLaboratoire d\&apos; Etudes et de Recherches en Teledetection Spatiale,  Laboratoire \nde Meteorologie Dynamique.\n\n\n   A TEST VERSION OF SPHINX IS AVAILABLE AT loasil.citilille.fr\n   (134.206.50.4) anonymous (bin : cd SPHINX : get ALL_SPHINX.tar.Z)\n\n   IN THE TEST VERSION THE OUTPUT FILES ARE DISABLE.

Strictly,\na 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change\nstate, according to the inputs.\n\nA demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine which\nof four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there are\nthree inputs required.\n\nA decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable\ninput, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, all\noutputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) output\nwill be low).\n\nAn eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) to\nselect which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve your\naim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note\nthat this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since\nyou have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left\nonce you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.\n\nA sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus\na mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use\nthe fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the\nfour enable lines.\n\nOf course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the\nfour final stage decoders.\n\nPlease give me the credit when you submit your homework.\n\nJohnH\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\/           School of MPCE\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\n\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&quot;, &apos;From: prb@access.digex.com (Pat)\nSubject: Re: Kawasaki 440 AE for sale.\nOrganization: Express Access Online Communications USA\nLines: 6\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: access.digex.net\n\n\n\nIncluded in thas  sale is a Cover  .

Also, are the clicks you mentioning the big\n&gt;&gt; clack that happens when it switches or are you refering to contact\n&gt;&gt; bounce?  How are you driving the relays?  TTL gate output?  Switching\n&gt;&gt; transistor?  How are the relays connected to what you are driving?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Need more specifics to answer your question!! :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; As a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer\n&gt; the circuit with the contacts.  The noise you hear is due to the momentary\n&gt; opening and closing of the path.\n&gt; \n&gt; The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high\n&gt; impedance audio circuits a resistive &quot;T&quot; is constructed close to characteristic\n&gt; impedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers\n&gt; the audio.\n&gt; \n&gt; In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are\n&gt; shorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic\n&gt; impedance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used\n&gt; to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Telephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to &quot;Make before\n&gt; break and Vica Versa&quot; but I haven\&apos;t seen any of these for years.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive &quot;optical isolator&quot;.. It consists\n&gt; of a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is\n&gt; off the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers\n&gt; passing the audio.  Once again this device in a &quot;T&quot; switches the audio.  Varying\n&gt; the lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and\n&gt; you have a mixer!\n&gt; \n&gt; Lots of luck!\n&gt; -- \n&gt; 73, Tom\n&gt; ================================================================================\n&gt; Tom Wagner, Audio Visual Technician.

I rode for\n&gt;leavitt&gt;five years before taking my first course (MSF ERC) and learning\n&gt;leavitt&gt;about how to countersteer.  It\&apos;s now eight years later, and I *still*\n&gt;leavitt&gt;have to consciously tell myself &quot;Don\&apos;t steer, COUNTERsteer!&quot;  Old\n&gt;leavitt&gt;habits die hard, and bad habits even harder.\n\n&gt;mjs&gt;Sorry Bill, but this is complete bollocks. You learned how to countersteer \n&gt;mjs&gt;the first time you rode the bike, it\&apos;s natural and intuitive. \n\n&gt;Sorry Mike, I\&apos;m not going to kick over the &quot;can you _not_ countersteer\n&gt;over 5mph?&quot; stone.  That one\&apos;s been kicked around enough.  For the sake of\n&gt;argument, I\&apos;ll concede that it\&apos;s countersteering (sake of argument only).\n\n&gt;mjs&gt;MSF did not teach you *how* to countersteer, it only told you what\n&gt;mjs&gt;you were already doing.\n\n&gt;And there\&apos;s no value in that? \n\n\nI didn\&apos;t say there was no value - all I said was that it is very confusing\nto newbies. \n\n&gt; There\&apos;s a BIG difference in: 1) knowing\n&gt;what\&apos;s happening and how to make it do it, especially in the extreme\n&gt;case of an emergency swerve, and: 2) just letting the bike do whatever\n&gt;it does to make itself turn.  Once I knew precisely what was happening\n&gt;and how to make it do it abruptly and on command, my emergency avoidance\n&gt;abilities improved tenfold, not to mention a big improvement in my normal\n&gt;cornering ability.  I am much more proficient &quot;knowing&quot; how to countersteer\n&gt;the motorcycle rather than letting the motorcycle steer itself.  That is,\n&gt;when I *remember* to take cognitive command of the bike rather than letting\n&gt;it run itself through the corners.  Whereupon I return to my original\n&gt;comment - better to learn what\&apos;s happening right from the start and how\n&gt;to take charge of it, rather than developing the bad habit of merely going\n&gt;along for the ride.\n\nBill, you are kidding yourself here. Firstly, motorcycles do not steer\nthemselves - only the rider can do that. Secondly, it is the adhesion of the\ntyre on the road, the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the\n motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, and\nnot the knowledge of physics between the rider\&apos;s ears. Are you seriously\nsuggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster\nor more competentlY than you could manage otherwise??\n\n\n&gt;Mike, I\&apos;m extremely gratified for you that you have such a natural\n&gt;affinity and prowess for motorcycling that formal training was a total\n&gt;waste of time for you (assuming your total &quot;training&quot; hasn\&apos;t come from\n&gt;simply from reading rec.motorcycles).  However, 90%+ of the motorcyclists\n&gt;I\&apos;ve discussed formal rider education with have regarded the experience\n&gt;as overwhelmingly positive.  This regardless of the amount of experience\n&gt;they brought into the course (ranging from 10 minutes to 10+ years).\n\nFormal training in this country (as far as I am aware) does not include\ncountersteering theory.  I found out about countersteering about six years ago,\nfrom a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist. I didn\&apos;t believe him\nat first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left,\nbut I went out and analysed closely what I was doing, and realized he was \nright! It\&apos;s an interesting bit of knowledge, and I\&apos;ve had a lot of fun since\nthen telling others about it, who were at first as sceptical as I was. But\nthat\&apos;s all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that\nit is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster\nor better as a result, is absurd.\n\nFormal training is in my view absolutely essential if you\&apos;re going to\nbe able to ride a bike properly and safely. But by including countersteering\ntheory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at\nthe time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn.\nAnd that was my original point.\n\nMike\n&apos;, &apos;From: dclaar@cup.hp.com (Doug Claar)\nSubject: Los Angeles Freeway traffic reports\nNntp-Posting-Host: hprtnyc.cup.hp.com\nOrganization: Hewlett-Packard\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8.9]\nLines: 4\n\n\noops, that\&apos;s KNX 1070.

Everybody\&apos;s got an\nopinion and is dead certain they are right.  Yet acurate information is\nextremely difficult to come by.  The DMV doesn\&apos;t know.  Cops don\&apos;t\nknow.  Your traffic school instructor doesn\&apos;t know.  The vehicle code\nonly tells part of the story.  Judges choose to interpret the laws in a\nwide variety of ways.  And the public at large?  I seldom hear any\nadvice that doesn\&apos;t disagree with something I\&apos;ve experienced.\n\nIf you don\&apos;t believe me I suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code,\nstudy it, and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what really\nhappens.  Read &quot;Fight Your Ticket&quot; too, but don\&apos;t miss the little\nsection at the end where it says your chances are lousy and you\&apos;re\nbasically screwed.\n\nAs you may have guessed, I\&apos;m pretty down on the system here in\nCalifornia.

If\n\tyou\&apos;re at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don\&apos;t\n\tdo it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,\n\tor your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;\n\tmistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.\n\n\tFurthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National\n\tElectrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).\n\tTo the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail\n\twith the electrical code, but we don\&apos;t quote sections\n\tsimply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we\&apos;re wrong,\n\twe invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!\n\n\tThe NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the\n\tforce of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,\n\thowever, do not.  Check your with your local building\n\tdepartment (and &lt;provincial&gt; Hydro Inspection Offices in\n\tCanada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,\n\tyour local electrical utility may also have special requirements\n\tfor electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that\n\twe say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family\n\tresidences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial\n\testablishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different\n\trules.\n\n\tAlso note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in\n\tsome parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary\n\tof the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.\n\tLots of things are the same, including voltages, line\n\tfrequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number\n\tof crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we\&apos;ve\n\tnoted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC\&apos;\&apos; or\n\t``CEC\&apos;\&apos;.\n\n\tRemember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often\n\tsmart to go beyond their minimal requirements.\n\nSubject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?\n\n\tThe NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the\n\tNational Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.\n\tIt\&apos;s revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.\n\tYou can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly\n\tat 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There\&apos;s the\n\tfull text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There\&apos;s an abridged\n\tedition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.\n\tAnd there\&apos;s the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized\n\tcommentary\&apos;\&apos; on the code, as well as the full text.  That\&apos;s the\n\trecommended version.  Unfortunately, there\&apos;s no handbook for\n\tthe abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --\n\tUS$65 plus shipping and handling.\n\nSubject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?\n\n\tThe Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up\n\tof various government agencies, power utilities, insurance\n\tcompanies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.\n\tThe CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two\n\tor three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,\n\tthis standard and publishes a province-specific code book.\n\tSince each province publishes its own slightly modified\n\tstandard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA\n\tstandard itself.  In this FAQ, &quot;CEC&quot; really means the\n\tappropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is\n\tderived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th\n\tedition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th\n\tedition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an\n\tattempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.\n\n\tThe appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical\n\tinspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In\n\tOntario, it\&apos;s Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn\&apos;t\n\toverly fat.  It\&apos;s about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I\n\thear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the\n\tequivalent NEC publications.\n\n\tDon\&apos;t bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout\n\tthe province.\n\nSubject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?\n\n\tIn most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.\n\tIn some, they\&apos;re not.  Check with your local electrical\n\tinspector.  Most places won\&apos;t permit you to do wiring on other\&apos;s\n\thomes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do\n\twiring in &quot;commercial&quot; buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)\n\tare usually considered &quot;semi-commercial&quot; or &quot;commercial&quot;.  However,\n\tmany jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial\n\twiring if you\&apos;re supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can\n\tfind one willing to supervise.\n\n\tIf you do your own wiring, an important point:\n\n\tDo it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better\n\tjob than an electrician will do.  After all, it\&apos;s your own home,\n\tand it\&apos;s you or your family that might get killed if you make\n\ta mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills\n\tand knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.\n\tIn this FAQ we\&apos;ve consciously given a few recommendations that\n\tare in excess of code, because we feel that it\&apos;s reasonable,\n\tand will impress the inspector.\n\n\tThe inspector will know that you\&apos;re an amateur.  You have to\n\tearn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your\n\ttime doing as neat a job as possible.  Don\&apos;t cut corners.\n\tExceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely\n\tpicky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.\n\n\tDon\&apos;t try to hide anything from the inspector.\n\n\tUse the proper tools.  Ie: don\&apos;t use a bread knife to strip\n\twires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector\n\twon\&apos;t like it, and the results won\&apos;t be that safe.  And it\n\ttakes longer.  And you\&apos;re more likely to stick a hunk of\n\t12ga wire through your hand that way.\n\n\tDon\&apos;t handle house wire when it\&apos;s very cold (eg: below -10C\n\tor 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types\n\tbecome very brittle.\n\nSubject: What do I need in the way of tools?\n\n\tFirst, there\&apos;s the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few\n\tscrewdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you\&apos;re \n\tlucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved\n\tdevices) you need Robertson (&quot;square recess&quot;) screwdrivers\n\t(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.\n\n\tFor drilling a few holes, a 3/4&quot; or 1&quot; spade bit and 1/4&quot; or\n\t3/8&quot; electric drill will do.  If you\&apos;re doing a lot, or\n\tare working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2&quot; drill\n\t(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and\n\t3/4&quot; or 1&quot; screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull\n\tyou through, so they\&apos;re much faster and less fatiguing, even\n\tin 90 year old hardwood timbers.\n\n\tScrew-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you\n\tinstall your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws\n\twork well).\n\t\n\tFor stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or\n\tordinary wire cutters.  Don\&apos;t buy the $3 K-mart &quot;combo stripper,\n\tcrimper and bottle opener&quot; types.  You should expect to pay\n\t$15 to $20 for a good &quot;plier-type&quot; pair.  It will have sized\n\tstripping holes, and won\&apos;t nick or grab the wire - it should\n\tbe easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the\n\tblade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There\n\tare fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren\&apos;t\n\tnecessary, and pros usually don\&apos;t use them.\n\n\tA pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends\n\tin constricted places.  Don\&apos;t use these for stripping wire.\n\n\tYou will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.\n\n\tYou should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling\n\tinside boxes and closing loops, but it\&apos;s better to form wire\n\tloops with a &quot;loop former hole&quot; on your wire stripper - more\n\taccurate.\n\n\tIf you\&apos;re using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for\n\tremoving the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the\n\tend of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,\n\tand simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a\n\t&quot;zipper&quot;, and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn\&apos;t try to strip\n\tthe sheath with a knife point, because it\&apos;s too easy to\n\tslash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley\n\tutility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)\n\tcan be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility\n\tthat you\&apos;ll gouge the conductors.\n\n\tFor any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it\&apos;s well\n\tworth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).\n\tHack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire\n\tor the insulation.\n\n\tThree-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired\n\toutlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more\n\texpensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple\n\tvoltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated\n\twire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost\n\tabout US$ 10 at Radio Shack.\n\n\tYou should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are\n\tdead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)\n\tand work well.  If you get more serious, a &quot;audible alarm&quot; type is\n\tgood for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I\&apos;ve been known\n\tto lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)\n\n\tFor running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.\n\tOften, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or\n\ta length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.\n\n\tElectrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent\n\twiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for\n\twrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap \n\taround the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination\n\tscrews - I don\&apos;t do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to\n\tprevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet\n\tthat has no cover plate).\n\nSubject: What is UL listing?\n\n\tThe UL stands for &quot;Underwriters Laboratory&quot;.  It used to be\n\tan Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent\n\tand non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment\n\tfor potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means\n\tthat the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements\n\tfor safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn\&apos;t necessarily\n\tmean that the device actually does what it\&apos;s supposed to, just\n\tthat it probably won\&apos;t kill you.\n\n\tThe UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are\n\tpermitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,\n\tinsurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will\n\tlimit their liability in case of a claim made in response to\n\tthe failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in\n\tmany situations the NEC will require that a wiring component\n\tused for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.\n\tIndirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring\n\tmust be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or\n\toccupancy permits issued.\n\t\nSubject: What is CSA approval?\n\n\tEvery electrical device or component must be certified by the\n\tCanadian Standards Association before it can be sold in\n\tCanada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done\n\twith CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to\n\tthe UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is\n\trequired by law.\n\n\tAgain, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved\n\tequipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the\n\tclaim.\n\n\tIn Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC\n\t(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to\n\tbe more a liason group between the CSA and insurance\n\tcompanies.\n\nSubject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?\n\n\tUSA: The following three books were suggested by our readers\n\n\t    Residential Wiring\n\t    by Jeff Markell,\n\t    Craftsman Books,\n\t    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.\n\n\t    Practical Electrical Wiring\n\t    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National\n\t    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70\n\t    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan\n\t    McGraw-Hill Book Co.\n\n\t    Wiring Simplified\n\t    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan\n\t    Park Publishing Co.\n\t\n\tTry to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC\n\trevision.  Which is currently 1990.\n\n\tCanada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called\n\t&quot;Electrical Code Simplified&quot;.  There appears to be a version\n\tpublished specific to each province, and is very tied into the\n\tappropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,\n\tand is indispensible for Canadian DIY\&apos;ers.  It is better to get\n\tthis book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer\n\tquestions on the net ;-).\n\n\tIt is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is\n\tavailable at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.\n\nSubject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?\n\n\tMost jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and\n\tinspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more\n\tmundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not\n\tliking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections\n\tprovides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors\n\tor subsequent owners of your home don\&apos;t get killed or lose\n\ttheir homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.\n\n\tMost jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your\n\thome, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a\n\tpermit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about\n\tthis.\n\n\tIf fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at\n\tfault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage\n\tclaims.\n\n\tIn general, the process goes like this:\n\t\t- you apply to your local inspections office or building\n\t\t  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or\n\t\t  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is\n\t\t  a good time to ask questions on any things you\&apos;re not\n\t\t  sure of.  If you\&apos;re doing major work, they may impose\n\t\t  special conditions on you, require loading\n\t\t  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point\n\t\t  they will tell you which inspections you will need.\n\t\t- If you\&apos;re installing a main panel, you will need to\n\t\t  have the panel and service connections inspected\n\t\t  before your power utility will provide a connection.\n\t\t  This is sometimes done by the local power authority\n\t\t  rather than the usual inspectors.\n\t\t- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before\n\t\t  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a\n\t\t  &quot;rough-in&quot; inspection.\n\t\t- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,\n\t\t  you will need a &quot;final inspection&quot;.\n\nSubject: My house doesn\&apos;t meet some of these rules and regulations.\n\tDo I have to upgrade?\n\n\tIn general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,\n\tthough there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some\n\tcases).  However, any new work must be done according to the\n\tlatest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major\&apos;\&apos; work, you\n\tmay be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all\n\tof your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.\n\nSubject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240\n\n\tOne thing where things might get a bit confusing is the\n\tdifferent numbers people bandy about for the voltage of\n\ta circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V\n\tor another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same\n\tthing...  In North America the utility companies are required\n\tto supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.\n\tThis works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there\n\tare resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it\&apos;s not\n\tunreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped\n\tto 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially\n\tat the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number\n\tof reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,\n\tdifferent people choose call them by slightly different numbers.\n\tThis FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them &quot;110V&quot; and\n\t&quot;220V&quot;, except when actually saying what the measured voltage will\n\tbe.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.\n\n\tOne thing that might make this a little more understandable\n\tis that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V\n\tinstead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device\n\tis designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that\n\tlow.\n\n\t208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between\n\tphases of a 3-phase &quot;Y&quot; circuit that is 120V from neutral to any\n\thot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase &quot;Y&quot;\n\tcircuit that\&apos;s 277V from hot to neutral.\n\n\tIn keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended\n\tto run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...\n\nSubject: What does an electrical service look like?\n\n\tThere are logically four wires involved with supplying the\n\tmain panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility\n\tpole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.\n\n \tThe bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded\n \tinto the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes\n \tto the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where\n\tthe main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic\n\taction conductivity &quot;breaks&quot; (often between copper and iron pipe)).\n\tThis is the &quot;grounding conductor&quot;.  It is there to make sure that\n\tthe third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire\n\tnormally carries no current.\n\n\tOne of the other wires will be white (or black with white or\n\tyellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.\n\tIt is connected to the &quot;centre tap&quot; (CEC; &quot;center tap&quot; in the\n\tNEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It\n\tis connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often\n\tinside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected\n\tanywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.\n\n\tFurthermore, there should only be one grounding system in\n\ta home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.\n\tThese will be connected together, or connected to the neutral\n\tat a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional\n\tgrounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house\n\twiring is unsafe and contrary to code.\n\n\tIf you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually\n\tbrought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are\n\tnot connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one\n\tneutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations \n\t(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do\n\thave to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your\n\tinspector.\n\n\tThe other two wires will usually be black, and are the &quot;hot&quot;\n\twires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as\n\twell.\n\n\tThe two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each\n\tother.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,\n\tthe voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the\n\twhite and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.\n\n\tSome panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.\n\tThis is either because the neutral and ground are connected\n\ttogether at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one\n\twire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some\n\trare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only\n\tservice).\n\nSubject: What is a circuit?\n\n\tInside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.\n\tThese connections are then used to supply power to selected\n\tportions of the home.  There are three different combinations:\n\t\t1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.\n\t\t2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.\n\t\t3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,\n\t\t   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.\n\n\t(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and\n\tlighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying\n\tpower to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they\n\toften have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several\n\tcircuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is\n\tusually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or\n\tair conditioners.\n\n\t[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar\n\tto (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there\n\tare two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral\n\tand ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing\n\tthe neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead\n\tof four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.\n\tWhen connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles\n\tare required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but\n\tthe NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,\n\tand found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to\n\tlocal practice -- there are restrictions on when this is\n\tpermissible.]\n\n\t(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,\n\twhite for neutral, and bare for grounding.\n\n\t(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a\n\tbare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.\n\n\tYou will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground\n\twire.  Since the white is &quot;hot&quot; in this case, both the NEC and CEC\n\trequires that the white wire be &quot;permanently marked&quot; at the ends\n\tto indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail\n\tpolish or sometimes electrical tape.\n\n\tEach circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the\n\tpanel through a circuit breaker or fuse.\n\n\tThere are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)\n\tor (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places\n\trequire this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is &quot;frame ground&quot;,\n\tthe other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an\n\talternative to GFCI protection.\n\nSubject: &quot;grounding&quot; versus &quot;grounded&quot; versus &quot;neutral&quot;.\n\n\tAccording to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the\n\t&quot;grounding&quot; conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green\n\tor bare wire.  The word &quot;neutral&quot; is reserved for the white when\n\tyou have a circuit with more than one &quot;hot&quot; wire.  Since the white\n\twire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the\n\tpanel, the proper term is &quot;grounded conductor&quot;.  However, the\n\tpotential confusion between &quot;grounded conductor&quot; and &quot;grounding\n\tconductor&quot; can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should\n\tnever use the bare wire as a &quot;grounded conductor&quot; or white wire\n\tas the &quot;grounding conductor&quot;, even though they are connected\n\ttogether in the panel.\n\n\t[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground\n\tseparately from the main panel.  Usually.]\n\n\tIn the trade, and in common usage, the word &quot;neutral&quot; is used\n\tfor &quot;grounded conductor&quot;.  This FAQ uses &quot;neutral&quot; simply to\n\tavoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use &quot;neutral&quot;\n\ttoo.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light\n\tswitch applications) neutral.  Not ground.\n\nSubject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?\n\n\tFuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power\n\tto a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For\n\texample, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should\n\t&quot;trip&quot;, protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As\n\tsuch, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the\n\twiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the\n\tequipment itself won\&apos;t cause a fire.\n\n\tFuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt\n\t(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby\n\tinterrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively\n\tfast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have\n\tlarge startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use\n\ta &quot;time-delay&quot; fuse (one brand is &quot;fusetron&quot;) which will avoid\n\ttripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a\n\tspring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be\n\treplaced.\n\n\tBreakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They\n\tusually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched\n\tinto position against another contact.  When the current flow\n\tthrough the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip\n\theats up and bends.  By bending it &quot;trips&quot; the latch, and the\n\tspring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave\n\tsimilarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to\n\ttrip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high\n\toverloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite\n\tnumber of times - each time they trip, or are thrown\n\twhen the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which\n\tdamages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in\n\tplace of switches unless they are specially listed for the\n\tpurpose.\n\n\tNeither fuses nor breakers &quot;limit&quot; the current per se.  A dead\n\tshort on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even\n\tthousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which\n\tcan often cause severe damage.\n\nSubject: Breakers?  Can\&apos;t I use fuses?\n\n\tStatistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher\n\trisk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually\n\tdue to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts\n\tcorroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse\n\tbeing installed, or the proverbial &quot;replace the fuse with a\n\tpenny&quot; trick.\n\n\tSince breakers are more permanently installed, and have better\n\tconnection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.\n\n\tFuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When\n\ta fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting\n\tpath.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,\n\tmelted service wiring, through fires in the electrical\n\tdistribution transformer and having your house burn down.\n\tBreakers don\&apos;t do this.\n\n\tMany jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit\n\tfuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new\n\tfuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special\n\tinserts to &quot;key&quot; the fuseholder to specific size fuses)\n\n\tSome devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse\n\tprotection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse\n\tis there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the\n\tlabeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently\n\tinstalled motors.  The installation instructions will tell you\n\tif you need one.\n\nSubject: What size wire should I use?\n\n\tFor a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,\n\tyou can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,\n\tthough, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid\n\tvoltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than\n\t14 gauge, though it\&apos;s stiffer and harder to work with.\n\n\tHere\&apos;s a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for\n\tmore than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or\n\tganged with other wires in a place where they can\&apos;t dissipate\n\theat easily:\n\n\t\tGauge\t\tAmps\n\t\t14\t\t15\n\t\t12\t\t20\n\t\t10\t\t30\n\t\t8\t\t40\n\t\t6\t\t65\n\t\n\tWe don\&apos;t list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent\n\ton the application and precise wire type.\n\nSubject: Where do these numbers come from?\n\n\tThere are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.\n\tThe smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When\n\tthe resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is\n\tmore voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need\n\thigher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in\n\tconduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long\n\truns.\n\n\tNeither effect is very significant over very short distances.\n\tThere are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller\n\twire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most\n\tlamps.  Don\&apos;t try this unless you\&apos;re certain that your use fits\n\tone of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger\n\twire.\n\nSubject: What does &quot;14-2&quot; mean?\n\n\tThis is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors\n\tin a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second\n\tthe number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but\n\tremember there\&apos;s usually an extra ground wire.  &quot;14-2&quot; means\n\t14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.\n\n\t-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes\n\tthe white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In\n\tthe latter case, the sheath is usually red too.\n\n\t-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.\n\tUsually carrying 220V with neutral.\n\nSubject: What is a &quot;wirenut&quot;/&quot;marrette&quot;/&quot;marr connector&quot;?  How are they\n\tused?\n\n\tA wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that\&apos;s used\n\tto connect wires together.  &quot;Marrette&quot; or &quot;Marr connector&quot;\n\tare trade names.  You\&apos;ll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.\n\n\tIn essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them\n\ttogether, then twist the wirenut on.\n\n\tThough some wirenuts advertise that you don\&apos;t need to twist the\n\twire, do it anyways - it\&apos;s more mechanically and electrically\n\tsecure.\n\n\tThere are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check\n\tthat the wire nut you\&apos;re using is the correct size for the\n\tquantity and sizes of wire you\&apos;re connecting together.\n\n\tDon\&apos;t just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or\n\tyour fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (&quot;linesman&quot;) pliers,\n\tand carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes\n\tit\&apos;s a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it\n\tgoes in the wirenut properly.\n\n\tSome people wrap the &quot;open&quot; end of the wirenut with electrical\n\ttape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may\n\ttear it off during an inspection.  It\&apos;s usually done because\n\ta bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead\n\tof taping it, the connection should be redone.\n\nSubject: What is a GFI/GFCI?\n\n\tA GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter\&apos;\&apos;.  It measures\n\tthe current current flowing through the hot wire and the\n\tneutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the\n\tpresumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other\n\tpath.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of\n\tan appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any\n\tof these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking\n\tthe circuit.\n\n\tGFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,\n\tfor example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral\n\tleads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI\n\twouldn\&apos;t help.  All of the current that passed from the hot\n\tlead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the\n\tGFCI happy.\n\n\tThe two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.\n\tOne is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed\n\t*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be\n\tprotected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices\n\tdownstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be\n\tcovered by a single GFCI outlet.\n\nSubject: Where should GFCIs be used?\n\n\tThe NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase\n\toutlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6\&apos; of the sink, garages,\n\tunfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or\n\tjust about anywhere else where you\&apos;re likely to encounter water\n\tor dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,\n\tthose dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space\&apos;\&apos;,\n\ttypically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and\n\tlaundry appliances.\n\n\tThe CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there\n\tis no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or\n\tbasement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you\n\thave a dirt floor, garage outlets if they\&apos;re near the door to\n\toutside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.\n\n\tEven if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may\n\twant to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI\n\tbreaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI\n\toutlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in\n\tCanada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your\n\tfinished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?\n\tDo you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does\n\twater or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?\n\nSubject: Where shouldn\&apos;t I use a GFCI?\n\n\tGFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don\&apos;t pose a\n\tsafety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run\n\tunattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,\n\tand sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs\n\tare sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that\n\tthe inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary\n\tcurrent imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most\n\tGFCI trips are real; if you\&apos;re getting a lot of trips for no\n\tapparent reason, you\&apos;d be well-advised to check your wiring\n\tbefore deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.\n\nSubject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?\n\n\tFor most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the\n\tfirst device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with\n\ta built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI\n\tbreakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE\n\tbreaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one\n\tmajor exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch\n\tcircuit\&apos;\&apos; (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),\n\tsuch as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you\&apos;ll need a\n\tmulti-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;\n\tthe cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on\n\twhat brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such\n\ta circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.\n\n\tOne more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use\n\tan oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use\n\tlarge (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You\&apos;ll thank yourself for it.\n\n\tIncidentally, if you\&apos;re installing a GFCI to ensure that one\n\tspecific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don\&apos;t\n\treally have to go to all of the trouble to find the first\n\toutlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet\n\tin the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But\n\tprotecting the whole circuit is preferred.\n\n\tWhen you install a GFCI, it\&apos;s a good idea to use the little\n\t&quot;ground fault protected&quot; stickers that come with it and mark\n\tthe outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which\n\toutlets are &quot;downstream&quot;, simply by tripping the GFCI with the\n\ttest button and see which outlets are dead.\n\nSubject: What\&apos;s the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?\n\n\tApart from their use in electronics, which we won\&apos;t comment on,\n\tand for certain fluorescent lights (they won\&apos;t turn on without\n\ta good ground connection), they\&apos;re intended to guard against\n\tinsulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of\n\tthe appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there\&apos;s an\n\tinsulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the\n\tground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly\n\ttrips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not\n\tgrounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if\n\tyou touch it while you\&apos;re grounded, you\&apos;ll get zapped.  Of\n\tcourse, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very\n\ttiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace\n\tungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).\n\n\tThere are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In\n\tparticular, that applies to toasters and anything else with\n\texposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating\n\telectrode in a toaster, and you\&apos;re not grounded, nothing will\n\thappen.  If you\&apos;re slightly grounded, you\&apos;ll get a small shock;\n\tthe resistance will be too high.  But if the case were\n\tgrounded, and you were holding it, you\&apos;d be the perfect path to\n\tground...\n\nSubject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization\n\n\tNowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the\n\tother.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)\n\ton one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.\n\tThis is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the\n\tthe shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to\n\thave an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).\n\n\tMost 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.\n\n\tThis requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right\n\tway around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the\n\tnarrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the\n\thot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.\n\tIf not, you can usually figure out which is which by which\n\tprong the terminating screw connects to.\n\nSubject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?\n\n\tThe NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance\n\tcircuits\&apos;\&apos; for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex\n\treceptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more\n\tthan 24&quot; (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider\n\tthan 12&quot; (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.\n\tThe circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except\n\tin the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits\n\tare in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,\n\tlighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6\&apos; of a sink *must* be\n\tprotected by a GFCI (NEC only).\n\n\tSplit duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab\n\tis broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to\n\tthe upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.\n\tThe neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When\n\t&quot;carrying through&quot; to another outlet, the neutral must be\n\tpigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral\n\tconnection fall off doesn\&apos;t cause the neutral to disconnect\n\tfrom downstream outlets.\n\nSubject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?\n\n\tThere must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to\n\tthe sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in\n\tthe light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.\n\nSubject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?\n\n\tRomex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.\n\tSometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.\n\tThis is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside\n\tstud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject\n\tto mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are\n\twired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several\n\tdifferent categories of NM cable.\n\n\tBX cable -- technically known as armored cable or &quot;AC&quot; has a\n\tflexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is\n\tfairly resistant to damage.\n\n\tTECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic\n\tsheath.\n\t\n\tProtection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable\n\tis run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer\n\tsurface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25&quot; (CEC &amp; NEC)\n\tfrom the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected\n\tfrom mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of\n\tmetal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.\n\n\t[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored\n\tcable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,\n\tbut this is technically illegal.]\n\n\tAdditional protection recommendations (these are rules in the\n\tCanadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague\n\treferences to &quot;exposed to mechanical damage&quot; in both the NEC\n\tand CEC):\n\n\t    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage\n\t      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls\n\t      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.\n\t      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.\n\t    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces\n\t      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian\n\t      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet\n\t      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable\n\t      or NM cable in flexible conduit to &quot;jump&quot; to the appliance.\n\t      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.\n\t    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating\n\t      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by\n\t      means of a 25mm/1&quot; air space, or suitable insulation\n\t      material (a wad of fiberglass).\n\t    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1\&apos; of every box\n\t      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5\&apos;.\n\t      Holes in joists or studs are considered &quot;supports&quot;.\n\t      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to\n\t      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,\n\t      it is permitted where &quot;proper&quot; support is impractical]\n\t    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.\n\t      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring\n\t      to the &quot;workmanship&quot; clause, but this seems more honoured\n\t      in the breach...]\n\t    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or\n\t      similar finish.\n\t    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.\n\t    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists\n\t      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more\n\t      than 1m (39&quot;).\n\n\tWhenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small\n\tplastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to\n\tprevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through\n\tthe insulation.\n\n\tBX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by\n\tsolid wall coverings.\n\n\tIn places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of\n\ta garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a\n\tUL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of\n\tfittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the\n\twire.\n\n\tService entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.\n\n\tIn damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will\n\tneed special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like\n\tvery heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of\n\tconduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground\n\twiring section.]\n\n \tThermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be\n \texposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that\n \tpurpose.\n\n\tMany electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through\n\tfurnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed\n\tby metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this\n\tis that if there\&apos;s a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses\n\tfrom burning insulation very rapidly through the building.\n\tTeflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.\n\t\n \tCanada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,\n \texcept that Canadian wire designations usually include the\n \ttemperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: &quot;AC90&quot; versus &quot;AC&quot;.\n\tIn the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.\n\n\tNOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes\n\tmost often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*.\n\tThere are very different requirements for mobile homes.\n\tCheck your local codes, *especially* if you\&apos;re doing anything\n\tthat\&apos;s the slightest out of the ordinary.\n\n\tWire selection table (incomplete - the real tables are enormous,\n\tuncommon wire types or applications omitted)\n\n\tCondition\t\t\tType\tCEC\tNEC\n\n\tExposed/Concealed dry\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNM\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tAC90\tAC\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\n\tExposed/Concealed damp\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNMC\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\n\tExposed/Concealed wet\t\tplastic\tNMWU90\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\t\n\tExposed to weather\t\tplastic\tNMWU\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTW etc.\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tTECK90\n\t\n\tDirect earth burial/\t\tplastic\tNMWU*\tUF\n\tService entrance\t\t\tRWU\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTWU\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tRA90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tACWU90\n\t[* NMWU not for service entrance]\n\nSubject: Should I use plastic or metal boxes?\n\n\tThe NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable\n\tonly.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box\n\titself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic\n\tboxes don\&apos;t use metal cable clamps.\n\n\tThe CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable\n\tarmor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still\n\tprovide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also\n\trequires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.\n\n\tThe advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for\n\tnon-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground\n\tconnection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other\n\thand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For\n\texposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.\n\nSubject: Junction box positioning?\n\n\tA junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.\n\n\tJunction boxes must be located in such a way that they\&apos;re accessible\n\tlater.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction\n\tboxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may\n\tget nasty.\n\nSubject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?\n\n\tIn general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few\n\tcaveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage\n\trating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half\n\ta dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire\n\tback to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle\n\tconstraints as well.  For example, older house\n\twiring doesn\&apos;t have high-temperature insulation.  The excess\n\theat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the\n\tinsulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.\n\tSome newer fixtures are specifically marked for high\n\ttemperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your\n\tceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case\n\treplacing any devices is a real adventure.)\n\n\tOther concerns include providing a suitable ground for some\n\tfluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and\n\tits mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy\n\tchandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box\n\tspecifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling\n\tjoists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available\n\tthat can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and\n\tmounted between the joists.\n\n\tThere are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as\n\t&quot;pot&quot; lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated\n\tceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.\n\tThe CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated\n\tceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a &quot;coffin&quot; (usually\n\t8\&apos;x16&quot;x12&quot; - made by making a pair of joists 12&quot; high, and covering\n\twith plywood) that doesn\&apos;t have any insulation.  (Yes, that\&apos;s 8 *feet*\n\tlong)\n\n\tNEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3&quot;\n\tclearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.\n\tThe rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,\n\twhich means that a CEC-style ``coffin\&apos;\&apos; might be worthwhile.\n\tPresumably, that\&apos;s up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn\&apos;t\n\tactually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector\n\trequirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can\&apos;t get\n\taccidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown\n\tin later.]\n\n\tThere are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and\n\tfairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are\n\tusually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat\n\tmore expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should\n\tensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.\n\tFollow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location\n\tfor the sensor can vary.\n\n\tThere does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved\n\tfor use in insulation.  The &quot;coffin&quot; appears the only legal approach.\n\nSubject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?\n\n\tThis usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is\n\tloose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up\n\tbeing more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with\n\trespect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can\n\tdestroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in\n\tsome situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions\n\trequire the stove frame connected to neutral).\n\n\tIf this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately\n\tand have them come and check out the problem.\n\n\tNote: a brief (&lt; 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with\n\tlighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A\n\tloose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness\n\tfar longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.\n\nSubject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?\n\n\tThree phase power has three &quot;hot&quot; wires, 120 degrees out of\n\tphase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors\n\tbecause it is more &quot;efficient&quot;, provides a bit more starting torque,\n\tand because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.\n\n\tYou\&apos;re most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows\n\t110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between\n\tany two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal\n\t220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the\n\ttwo hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.\n\n\tBringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually\n\tridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you\n\twant to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to\n\tbuy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is\n\tpossible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have\n\ta &quot;capacitor start&quot; unit, or use a larger motor as a\n\t(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if\n\tthe motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to\n\treplace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop\&apos;\&apos; has an\n\tarticle on how to do this if you must.\n\n\tNote that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using\n\tsuch a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.\n\nSubject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?\n\n\tTheoretically, it doesn\&apos;t make any difference.  However, there\n\tis a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply\n\twiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times\n\tless power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also\n\tmeans that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor\n\twill get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the\n\tsmaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.\n\n\tThis is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more\n\tthan 50 feet long.\n\nSubject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?\n\n\tIt is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746\n\twatts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,\n\tit is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200\n\twatts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,\n\tso it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational\n\tefficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.\n\n\tSome equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router\n\tmanufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far\n\tin excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a &quot;stall\n\thorsepower&quot; or similar.  That means the power is measured when\n\tthe motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.\n\tWhat they don\&apos;t mention is that if you kept it in that\n\tcondition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker\n\twill trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it\&apos;s drawing far\n\tmore current than it can continuously.\n\n\tWhen comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This\n\tshould be on the motor nameplate.  If you can\&apos;t find that figure,\n\tcheck the amperage rating, which is always present.\n\nSubject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?\n\n\tOlder homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead\n\tof the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety\n\tground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither\n\tthe NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.\n\n\tThere are several different approaches to solving this:\n\t    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the\n\t       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect\n\t       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle\n\t       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.\n\t    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and\n\t       it\&apos;s continuous to the main house ground point, you can\n\t       run a conductor to it from the third prong.\n\t    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.\n\t    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug\n\t       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI\n\t       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI\n\t       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong\n\t       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,\n\t       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it\n\t       wouldn\&apos;t be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault\n\t       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected\n\t       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren\&apos;t\n\t       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath\n\t       on BX cable.\n\n\tThe CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three\n\tprong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.\n\tLike caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.\n\nSubject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?\n\tShould the test button work?\n\n\tWe\&apos;re sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,\n\tthat your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there\&apos;s\n\ta resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE\n\tside of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current\n\tthrough this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.\n\tThis is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn\&apos;t require\n\ta real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press\n\tthe TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:\n\tif the test button doesn\&apos;t work, something\&apos;s broken, and potentially\n\tdangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.\n\n\tThe instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground\n\twire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The\n\tcauses may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the\n\tformalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never\n\ttested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,\n\tUL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device\n\tbehaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded\n\toutlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are\n\tlabeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician\n\twas surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require\n\tit, and promised to investigate.)\n\nSubject: How should I wire my shop?\n\n\tAs with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all\n\tdevices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies\n\tthat you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the\n\tcircuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for\n\tthe major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or\n\tshop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have\n\tbig motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp\n\tbreakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles\n\twhich means you\&apos;d have to &quot;replug&quot; all your equipment.  Lights\n\tshould either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared\n\twith circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two\n\tseparate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a\n\tsituation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand\n\tRPM, while you\&apos;re groping in the dark for the OFF switch.\n\n\tDo install lots of outlets.  It\&apos;s easier to install them in the\n\tbeginning, when you don\&apos;t have to cut into an existing cable.\n\tIt\&apos;s useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each\n\tpoint, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same\n\ttime as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and\n\tplates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have\n\tobjects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit\n\twrong.\n\n\tNote that some jurisdictions have a &quot;no horizontal wiring&quot;\n\trule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used\n\tfor working.  What this means is that all wiring must be\n\trun along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.\n\n\tOther possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V\n\tcircuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.\n\tDon\&apos;t overload circuits, and don\&apos;t use extension cords if you\n\tcan help it, unless they\&apos;re rated for high currents.  (A coiled\n\textension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of\n\tthe same gauge.  Also, the insulation won\&apos;t withstand as much\n\theat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)\n\n\tIf your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,\n\tyou should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop\n\twiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to\n\tequip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.\n\tIf you want to install individual switches to ``safe\&apos;\&apos;\n\tparticular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.\n\tFor example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to\n\thandle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy\n\t``horsepower-rated\&apos;\&apos; switches instead.\n\n\tFinally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished\n\tbasements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And\n\teven if you ``know\&apos;\&apos; that you\&apos;d never use one of your shop\n\toutlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might\n\thave a different idea.\n\n\tNote: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop\n\twiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.\n\nSubject: Underground Wiring\n\n\tYou will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use\n\tspecial wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic\n\ttubing and possibly lumber (don\&apos;t use creosoted lumber, it rots\n\tthermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion\n\tof lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is\n\tgenerally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically\n\tlisted for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,\n\tfittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion\n\tin water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And\n\tof course, don\&apos;t forget the GFCIs.\n\n\tThe required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to\n\tjurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about\n\tyour specific situation.\n\n\tA hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says &quot;buried power\n\tline&quot; and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.\n\nSubject: Aluminum wiring\n\n\tDuring the 1970\&apos;s, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became\n\tquite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,\n\taluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,\n\tand most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.\n\tWe recommend, even if you\&apos;re allowed to, that do not use it for new\n\twiring.\n\n\tBut don\&apos;t panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum\n\twiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.\n\tAluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper\n\tinstallation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential\n\tproblems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.\n\n\tThe main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as\n\t&quot;cold creep&quot;.  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When\n\tit cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes\n\tthrough a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each\n\ttime.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes\n\twhen in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance\n\tof the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/\n\toxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,\n\tmelt the insulation or fixture it\&apos;s attached to, and possibly even\n\tcause a fire.\n\n\tSince people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move\n\tinto a house built during the 70\&apos;s, we will cover basic points of\n\tsafe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you\&apos;re considering purchasing\n\ta home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you\n\thire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring\n\tfor the following things:\n\n\t    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to\n\t       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will\n\t       be stamped with &quot;Al/Cu&quot; or &quot;CO/ALR&quot;.  The latter supersedes\n\t       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat\n\t       more expensive than the ordinary ones.\n\n\t    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around\n\t       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be\n\t       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the\n\t       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug\n\t       up each connection.\n\n\t       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the\n\t       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.\n\n\t    3) &quot;push-in&quot; terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.\n\t       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with\n\t       the proper screw connections immediately.\n\n\t    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,\n\t       melted insulation, or &quot;baked&quot; fixtures.  Any such damage should\n\t       be repaired.\n\t    \n\t    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be\n\t       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the\n\t       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting\n\t       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be\n\t       connected together using special crimp devices, with an\n\t       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter\n\t       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless\n\t       you can rent the tool.\n\n\t    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring\n\t       by means of a short copper &quot;pigtail&quot;.  See (5) above.\n\t    \n\t    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped\n\t       (not nicked) wire etc.\n    \n\tIf, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring\n\tshows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider\n\tthe wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,\n\twe suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,\n\tyou can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having\n\tthis professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.\n\tYou can do this yourself too.\n\nSubject: I\&apos;m buying a house!  What should I do?\n\n\tCongratulations.  But...  It\&apos;s generally a good idea to hire\n\tan inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.\n\tNot just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an\n\tinspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor\n\tones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any\n\tminor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many\n\tplaces, we suggest you look elsewhere.\n\n\tHere\&apos;s some hints on what to look for:\n\n\tObvious non-code wiring can include:\n\n\t\t- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls\n\t\t- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without\n\t\t  proper marking.\n\t\t- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of\n\t\t  a GFCI)\n\t\t- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)\n\t\t- Switched neutrals\n\t\t- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines\n\n\tCertain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one\n\ttime) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:\n\n\t\t- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps\n\t\t   not properly terminated wiring)\n\t\t- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are\n\t\t  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when\n\t\t  it\&apos;s *really* convenient ;-)\n\t\t- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations\n\t\t- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps\n\t\t- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them\n\t\t- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or\n\t\t  ceiling\n\t\t- Backwrapped grounding wires\n\nSubject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring\n\t\n\tIn the years since Edison &quot;invented&quot; electricity, several different\n\twiring &quot;styles&quot; have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you\n\tmay encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old \n\tmethods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.\n\n\tThe oldest wiring system you\&apos;re likely to encounter is called\n\t&quot;knob and tube&quot; (K&amp;T).  It is made up of individual conductors with\n\ta cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural\n\tmembers (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).\n\tWire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections\n\twere made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping\n\twith tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,\n\tthe wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs\n\tdown the centre of each room, with &quot;taps&quot; off to each fixture.\n\tThe hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some\n\tcases K&amp;T isn\&apos;t colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same\n\tcolour as the hot wires.\n\n\tYou\&apos;ll see K&amp;T in homes built as late as the 40\&apos;s.\n\n\tComments on K&amp;T:\n\n\t\t- the people installing K&amp;T were pretty paranoid about\n\t\t  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.\n\t\t- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up\n\t\t  very well.  Most K&amp;T I\&apos;ve seen, for example, is in\n\t\t  quite good condition.\n\t\t- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.\n\t\t- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with\n\t\t  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,\n\t\t  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.\n\t\t- Sometimes the neutral isn\&apos;t balanced very well between\n\t\t  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to\n\t\t  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on\n\t\t  any circuit.\n\t\t- Building code does not permit insulation in walls\n\t\t  that contain K&amp;T.\n\t\t- Connection to existing K&amp;T from new circuits can be\n\t\t  tricky.  Consult your inspector.\n\t\t- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more\n\t\t  outlets to be installed than K&amp;T systems did.\n\t\n\tSince K&amp;T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn\&apos;t\n\tnecessary to replace it simply because it\&apos;s K&amp;T.  What you should\n\twatch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and\n\tbe cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it\&apos;s perfectly\n\treasonable to leave existing K&amp;T alone, and add new fixtures on\n\tnew circuits using modern techniques.\n\t\n\tAfter K&amp;T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type\n\tyou will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks\n\tmuch like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was\n\tused in the 40\&apos;s and 50\&apos;s.  Again, no grounding conductor.\n\tIt was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback\n\tis that this type of insulation embrittles.  We\&apos;ve seen whole\n\tsystems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at\n\ta touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.\n\n\tThis stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if\n\tthe wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as\n\tmuch as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.\n\tA simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several\n\thour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink\n\ttubing.\n\n\tAfter this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.\n\tIt\&apos;s almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.\n\tThis stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn\&apos;t present a hazard\n\tand is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be\n\treplaced - it should be considered as safe as the &quot;modern&quot; stuff -\n\tthermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don\&apos;t abuse it too much.\n\nSubject: Where do I buy stuff?\n\n\tTry to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.

I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.\nspec version of Exar&apos;s XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C\nand sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time\ndelay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this\napplication, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger\npins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is\ndisabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.\nWhen triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x\nthe timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can\nbe programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting\nany combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it\nis, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K\nresistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of\n2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)\nOf course, that&apos;s much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for\n256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the &apos;pellet puker&apos;.\nAfter the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14\nday timing cycle and so forth.\n\nPower is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the\nelectronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet\npuker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to\nkeep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to\nwork for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts\nto spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240&apos;s to see\nwhat I can do with them.

I&apos;m new to motorcycles so no flames please.  I don&apos;t\n&gt;have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:\n&gt;\n&gt;[...]  Any stories on how you all learned?\n\nI&apos;ll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\n\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner&apos;s course, so I\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\n\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\nI also passed my road test.\n\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\na car and been killed.\n\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\nas I did.\n\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner&apos;s course first thing.  I\nwouldn&apos;t even buy a bike until you&apos;ve taken the course, unless you\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\nyou&apos;re ready to use it.\n\n&gt;1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \n&gt;to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I&apos;m too \n&gt;ignorant to know I need to buy)\n\nWhile you&apos;re waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you&apos;re looking at maybe $600 not\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\n\n&gt;2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in \n&gt;about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up\n&gt;till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a \n&gt;motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes\n&gt;a difference)\n\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\npoor.  I&apos;d guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\nmore expensive.\n\n&gt;3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?\n\nThere used to be annual buyer&apos;s guides in the usual motorcycle\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend&apos;s advice\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW&apos;s running around\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\n\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\nshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,\nwere very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and\nquoting prices for bikes that weren&apos;t the latest models (hence\ncheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\n\n-- David Karr (karr@cs.cornell.edu)\n-- &apos;80 BMW R65   DoD #0969   also BMWMOA, NRA, ACLU, et al.\n\n\n&quot;, &quot;From: jlevine@rd.hydro.on.ca (Jody Levine)\nSubject: Re: Countersteering_FAQ please post\nOrganization: Ontario Hydro - Research Division\nLines: 12\n\nIn article &lt;1993Apr15.200857.10631@adobe.com&gt; cjackson@adobe.com (Curtis Jackson) writes:\n&gt;\n&gt;So perhaps it is only *some* waterski bikes on which one countersteers...\n\nA Sea Doo is a boat.

This is a PhD research project and I have to test\n&gt;the chip at speed on a PCB.

Where\nexactly are you running 100MHz??  THe digital side?  TTL?\nECL?

I don&apos;t see a problem in packaging as long\nas you adhere to sound engineering practices.  \n\nA good source of information is Motorola&apos;s MECL System Design\nHandbook. The latest ed. is dated 2/88.  That is considered\nto be one of the *bibles* in high-speed design.\n\nThe very fact that you need to build a test fixture means\nyou&apos;re most likely going to need a socket.  It in itself\nhas far more inductance per pin than the package you are\ntesting, not to mention any impedance discontinuities.  I\ndon&apos;t see the big concern over the packaging because it\nprobably isn&apos;t going to make that much difference\n\nIf you&apos;re trying to get TTL to run at 100MHz, have fun...\nTTL was never designed to run in a 100MHz environment.\n:-(\n\naaron\n\nP.S.

Since we apparently\ndon\&apos;t have the sensor base you folks have, they\&apos;re installing\ncameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests\nare going to be in the Santa Clara area I\&apos;m told), with the\nvideo being piped into a command center they\&apos;re building\nsomewhere in the East Bay.  I\&apos;m not sure if frame grabbers or\ncheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large\nmulti-colored status displays will show the various routes\nusing different colors to represent the various average speeds\nfor each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in front\nof the status \&apos;wall\&apos;, and will relay continuous verbal traffic\nstatus to those who want to receive it.  They\&apos;re apparently also\nlooking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to\nproviding continuous audio from this system.\n\nIn the mean time, they\&apos;ll set up large incandescent display\nboards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data\non traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that the\nsystem is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it\nwill be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system is\nsimilarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read\n&quot;cheap&quot;).\n\nWe also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP\naudio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal\nreports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle\nreceivers like the \&apos;Auto Talk\&apos; that the information coming next is\napplicable to a given area.  In LA, they\&apos;re probably using some\nother TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your\nstereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station\njumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information.\nI believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle\nreceivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly\nfees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers\ndon\&apos;t have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely\ntrue), they likely have no investment in keeping the system\nup and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You\nmay have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing\nmore, when this happens.

I have tried\nwriting some assembler code to get the modes working and I have found out\nthat each pixel is addressed by a word ( 16 bit ), but only the lower 8 bits\nare considered ( this happens in 800x600 mode, the 640x480 mode refuses to\nwork i.e. remains in text mode ).\nCould someone please help me.\n\nTristan\n&quot;, &quot;From: paj@uk.co.gec-mrc (Paul Johnson)\nSubject: Peltier Effect Heat Pumps\nReply-To: paj@uk.co.gec-mrc (Paul Johnson)\nOrganization: GEC-Marconi Research Centre, Great Baddow, Essex\nLines: 45\n\n\nI was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when I\ncame across a range of Peltier Effect heat pumps intended for cooling\ncomponents.  For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a\ncurrent through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side\nto the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I\nthink a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.\n\nAnyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for\npicnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a\ncouple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an\nefficiency of 80-90%, which ain&apos;t bad (although it would flatten my\ncar battery in about half an hour).\n\nUnfortunately the catalogue didn&apos;t list anything more than the basic\nspecs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the\ntemperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably\nits power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we\nhave a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no\nleakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the\ntwo sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more\n(although that would be a lousy way to control it).\n\nWhat I would like to know is:\n\n1: Are the above guesses correct?\n\n2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?\n   (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm\n   too fast when I unplug it)\n\n3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?  It looks like\n   magic!\n\n4: Why don&apos;t they use these things in domestic fridges/freezers?\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nPaul.\n\nPaul Johnson (paj@gec-mrc.co.uk).\t    | Tel: +44 245 73331 ext 3245\n--------------------------------------------+----------------------------------\nThese ideas and others like them can be had | GEC-Marconi Research is not\nfor $0.02 each from any reputable idealist. | responsible for my opinions\n&quot;, &quot;Subject: 68HC16 public domain software?\nFrom: murashiea@mail.beckman.com (Ed Murashie)\nOrganization: DSG Development Eng Beckman Instruments Inc.\nNntp-Posting-Host: 134.217.245.87\nLines: 11\n\nDoes anyone know of an FTP site where I might find public\ndomain software for the Motorola 68HC16 microprocessor?\nI am looking for a basic interpreter/compilier or a &apos;C&apos;\ncompiler.

I have so far\n&gt;avoided forking out the roughly $150 for the Suzuki part by kludging in\n&gt;different Honda regulator/rectifier units from junkyards.  The charging system\n&gt;consistently overcharges the battery.

I suspect they were underspecified;\nit didn\&apos;t help that they were well removed from cool air.\n\nBattery access on the earlier bikes doesn\&apos;t require tank removal.\nAfter you learn the drill, it\&apos;s pretty straightforward.\n\n[...]\n&gt;replacement parts, like all Suzuki parts, are outrageously expensive.\n\nHaving bought replacement parts for several brands of motorcycles,\nI\&apos;ll offer a grain of salt to be taken with Dale\&apos;s assessment.\n\n[...]\n&gt;Good luck, and be careful!\n&gt;--Dale\n\nSentiments I can\&apos;t argue with...or won\&apos;t...\n-- Dean Deeds\n\tdeeds@vulcan1.edsg.hac.com\n&apos;, &apos;From: stefan@prague (Stefan Fielding-Isaacs)\nSubject: Racelist: WHO WHAT WHERE\nDistribution: rec\nOrganization: Gain Technology, Palo Alto, CA.\nLines: 111\nNntp-Posting-Host: prague.gain.com\n\n\n Greetings fellow motorcycle roadracing enthusiasts!\n\n BACKGROUND\n ----------\n\n The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions \n devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad \n interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism, \n roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,\n motosports enthusiasts.\n\n The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little\n over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from\n New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada\n Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.\n\n The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need \n to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of \n performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise \n ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.\n\n Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to \n issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be &quot;flame-free&quot;.  \n\n HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION\n ---------------------------------\n\n You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:\n\n\n        race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day\n (depending on the topic). \n\n   NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the\n       list directly.\n \n After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive\n an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner\n so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in\n order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.\n \n Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily\n or digest distribution (as per your initial request).\n\n HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION\n ----------------------------------\n\n It is possible to receive the list in \&apos;digest\&apos;ed form (ie. a\n single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out \n whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the\n frequency of postings this appears to be about every other\n day.\n\n Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every \n 30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:\n\n\n        digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n HOW TO POST TO THE LIST\n -----------------------\n\n This is an open forum. To post an article to the list, send to:\n\n\n        race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may\n not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it\n (though this isn\&apos;t necessarily a guarantee that it went out)\n you can include a &quot;metoo&quot; line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX\n based mail systems). \n\n BOUNCES\n -------\n\n Because I haven\&apos;t had the time (or the inclination to replace\n the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with\n bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally,\n sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of\n employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive\n bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully, and\n if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I\n administer this list) contact me through my administration\n hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com). If not, ignore the bounce. \n\n OTHER LISTS \n -----------\n\n        Two-strokes:     2strokes@microunity.com\n        Harleys:         harley-request@thinkage.on.ca\n                         or  uunet!watmath!thinkage!harley-request\n        European bikes:  majordomo@onion.rain.com\n                         (in body of message write: subscribe euro-moto)\n\n\n thanks, be seeing you, \n Rich (race list administrator)\n\n rich@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n-- \nStefan Fielding-Isaacs                                415.822.5654 office/fax\ndba Art &amp; Science              &quot;Books By Design&quot;      415.599.4876 voice/pager\nAMA/CCS #14\n* currently providing consulting writing services to: Gain Technology, Verity *\n&apos;, &apos;From: d91-hes@tekn.hj.se (STEFAN HERMANSSON)\nSubject: re: Vesa on the Speedstar 24\nOrganization: H|gskolan i J|nk|ping\nLines: 8\nNntp-Posting-Host: pc9_b109.et.hj.se\n\n\n\n\tJust posting to John Cormack.\nI wanted to tell you that there is a &quot;slight&quot; difference between \nSpeedstar 24 and Speedstar 24X\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t/Stefan\n&apos;, &apos;From: jgreen@amber (Joe Green)\nSubject: Re: Weitek P9000 ?\nOrganization: Harris Computer Systems Division\nLines: 14\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: amber.ssd.csd.harris.com\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9]\n\nRobert J.C.

Previously\n&gt; a MC68882RC25 was installed and everything was working perfectly.  Now the\n&gt; systems displays a yellow screen (indicating a exception) when it check for\n&gt; the presence/type of FPU.  When I reinstall an MC68882RC25 the system works\n&gt; fine, but with the XC68882 even at 25 MHz it does not work.  The designer\n&gt; of the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor on data_strobe (470 Ohm)\n&gt; might help, but that didn&apos;t change anything.  Does anybody have some\n&gt; suggestions what I could do?  Does this look like a CPU-FPU communications\n&gt; problem or is the particular chip dead (it is a pull, not new)?\n&gt; Moreover, the place I bought it from is sending me an XC68882RC33.  I thought\n&gt; that the 68882RC33 were labeled MC not XC (for not finalized mask design). \n&gt; Are there any MC68882RC33?\n\nI, too, have a XC68882RC50 math coprocessor, which I installed\nsuccesfully in my Mega Midget Racer (clocked at 33 MHz).

What they want\n|&gt; to do is to place this thing on the Antartic ice shelf and measure the amount\n|&gt; of snow fall over a period of six weeks. Every two weeks, they want to trip a\n|&gt; selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the\n|&gt; snow. Then by digging down into the snow, the snow fall amount can be measured\n|&gt; as they come to the different color pellets.\n|&gt; \n|&gt; The problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold (-40 degrees)\n|&gt; and a power source that wouldn\&apos;t drain. I have looked at the XR-2204 timers and\n|&gt; the standard NE556 dual timers, but thier temp specs won\&apos;t go that low. Also,\n|&gt; two weeks equates to 1,209,600 seconds per firing, which means one big timing\n|&gt; cap ! I have found 2.2 farad (yes, Farad !) caps that have a working voltage of\n|&gt; 5 volts and are small in size. But again, the time of discharge at -40 or lower\n|&gt; degrees isn\&apos;t linear. I was thinking of using several timers chained together \n|&gt; to fire the selonid at the end of the timing period, but that blasted cold and\n|&gt; the drain on a battery over six weeks is the pain. One possibility would be to\n|&gt; use solar panels, but this is during the six month twilight. Anyone have any\n|&gt; good ideas ?\n|&gt; \n|&gt; Thanks in advance...\n|&gt; \n|&gt; -=-= Wes =-=-\n\nFirstly, I would never consider trying to make a one-shot timer. Your 2F2 cap\nwill have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in\napplications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their\nperformance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap.\nThe other point is that big electro\&apos;s are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances,\nso calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering\nthe cold).\n\nYou should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain,\nthat &quot;rolls over&quot; (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every\n1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would\nneed a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the\nfiring times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz\noscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator\nremaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.\n\nI would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the\nsolenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.\n\nCaveat - I\&apos;m not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can\&apos;t\nguarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable\nconditions.\n\nJohnH\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\/           School of MPCE\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\n\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&apos;, &quot;From: esuoc@csv.warwick.ac.uk (Ajay Soni)\nSubject: Re: Please Recommend 3D Graphics Library For M\nOrganization: Computing Services, University of Warwick, UK\nLines: 44\nDistribution: world\nReply-To: esuoc@csv.warwick.ac.uk\nNNTP-Posting-Host: thyme.csv.warwick.ac.uk\n\n\n\n\nIn article 2G1@bcstec.ca.boeing.com, rgc3679@bcstec.ca.boeing.com (Robert G.

They look like cylinders\n&gt;&gt; &gt;that have been pinched in the middle. Does anybody know what the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;actual purpose of those things are?. I hear that they\&apos;re called\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\&apos;Cooling Towers\&apos; but what the heck do they cool?\n&gt;Great Explaination, however you left off one detail, why do you always\n&gt;see them at nuclear plants, but not always at fossil fuel plants.  At\n&gt;nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle, whereas\n&gt;fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot\n&gt;water.  As I recall the water isn\&apos;t as hot (thermodynamically) in many\n&gt;fossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactive\n&gt;contamination.\n\n       Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual \nboiling-water reactor nuclear plants.  (There\&apos;s a gripe in the industry\nthat nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it\&apos;s\nmore important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system\nas cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.  \n\n       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they\nusually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the\nway down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,\nrather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about &quot;thermal \npollution&quot; de-icing a river, said, &quot;Up here, we view heat as a resource&quot;.  \n\n       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is \npurified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when\nthe water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than \ncooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJohn Nagle\n&apos;, &apos;From: svoboda@rtsg.mot.com (David Svoboda)\nSubject: Re: edu breaths\nNntp-Posting-Host: corolla18\nOrganization: Motorola Inc., Cellular Infrastructure Group\nLines: 29\n\nIn article &lt;1993Apr15.214910.5676@rtsg.mot.com&gt; declrckd@rtsg.mot.com (Dan J.

That is,\nI have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some\nrandom 50mV bias.\n\tThe other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output\nwon&apos;t go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessed\nfrom my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the input\nimpedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits have\nmaximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most have\ninput impedances in the 10&apos;s of Kohm range. The thing is, in order to\nuse my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing\nreasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my\ncircuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series.\nWith the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now\nwith this little divider there I have to figure that in. It&apos;s kind of\na pain in  the ass.\n\tIs there any way I could make myself a little box that could\nsolve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generator\ninput, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some\nlow, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factor\nof one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I&apos;d\nlike to have this box not be active.\n\tAny quick ideas.

The whole amplifier is extremely solid\n  with massive heat sinks and very solid casing.\nIf you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components \n  in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect\n  symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each\n  channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are\n  virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.\n\nI was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east\n  or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components\n  they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the\n  amplifiers sound so brilliant.\nI cannot see why people say the amplifier won&apos;t last - not with\n  those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly\n  hot - but that&apos;s how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.\n\nMy last point, I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like\n  the 545 or something.  It was two years old and it still sounded\n  like new.\n\nIf you build an amplifier decently, like the Adcom&apos;s, they will\n  sound brilliant and last a long time - period.\n\nJust my thoughts, but then - I do own one of Adcom&apos;s amps.\n\n--\n***********************************************************************\n**    Alan Webber                                                    **\n**                      webb@itu1.sun.ac.za                          **\n**                      webb@itu2.sun.ac.za                          **\n**                                                                   **\n** The path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high  **\n** The ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by          **\n** Apprehension creeping like a choo-train up your spine             **\n** Will the tightrope reach the end; will the final couplet rhyme    **\n***********************************************************************\n&quot;, &apos;From: bean@ra.cgd.ucar.edu (Gregory Bean)\nSubject: Help!

For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a\n&gt;current through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side\n&gt;to the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I\n&gt;think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.\n&gt;\n&gt;Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for\n&gt;picnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a\n&gt;couple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an\n&gt;efficiency of 80-90%, which ain\&apos;t bad (although it would flatten my\n&gt;car battery in about half an hour).\n&gt;\n So-Called Cool-Hot boxes have been advetised for several years.  I recall\nDamark advertising them in a recent catalog.  Problem with the units is they do\na sh***y job of keeping food cold/warm.  The peliter devices used just don\&apos;t\nseem to have enough punch to keep up.  If you want something hot, you need to\nheat it up before you put it in the box, and end up hours later with food thats\nonly moderately warm.  Same goes for cold items.\n\n&gt;Unfortunately the catalogue didn\&apos;t list anything more than the basic\n&gt;specs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the\n&gt;temperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably\n&gt;its power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we\n&gt;have a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no\n&gt;leakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the\n&gt;two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more\n&gt;(although that would be a lousy way to control it).\n&gt;\n&gt;What I would like to know is:\n&gt;\n&gt;1: Are the above guesses correct?\n&gt;\n&gt;2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?\n&gt;   (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm\n&gt;   too fast when I unplug it)\n\n You\&apos;de probably be better off getting a good Coleman(tm) cooler and stocking\nup on &quot;blue ice&quot; blocks.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?

I don\&apos;t know if it\&apos;s adjustable, but my source says it\&apos;s\n&gt;more difficult to pick than most locks, and the cable tends to squish flat\n&gt;in bolt-cutter jaws rather than shear (5/8&quot; model).\n&gt;\n&gt;\tFYI, I\&apos;ll be getting a Krypto cable next paycheck.\n\nA word of warning, though:  Kryptonite also sells almost useless cable\nlocks under the Kryptonite name.\n\nWhen I obtained my second motorcycle, I migrated one of my Kryptonite \nU-locks from my bicycle to the new bike.  I then went out shopping for\na new lock for the bicycle.\n\nFor about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock\n(advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both,\nKryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel).\nI chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week, I took it back in\ndisgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.\n\nFirst, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by\nthe Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn\&apos;t even approach Kryptonite standards of\nquality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable\nlock with the Kryptonite name on it.\n\nSecondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  I\ndon\&apos;t know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often\nquite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes\nit would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.\n\nThirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves\nthe sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the \ndark.  I didn\&apos;t try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the \nlock mechanism would stand up to an &quot;insert screwdriver and TORQUE&quot;\nattack.\n\nFourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to \ndeter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is).  All cables suffer the\nweakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time.  If you are patient\nyou can cut cables with fingernail clippers.

Even today, they use the cheapest possible coax running  \ninto problems they can&apos;t solve anymore.

The electronics and dynamics of the ink\ncartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch.\nOn almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.\n\nThe method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer\nresults in much less spread than ink drop technology.\n\nIt doesn&apos;t take much investigation to see that the mechanical and\nelectronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than\ninexpensive ink jet printers.  Recall also that laser printers\noffer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1\nppm for an ink jet printer.\n\nSomething else to think about is the cost of consumables over the\nlife of the printer.  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about\n$US 75-80 at discount while HP high capacity (~500-1000 page yield)\ncartridges are about $US 22 at discount.  It could be that over the\nlife cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are\nless than ink jet printers.  It is getting progressively closer\nbetween the two technologies.  Laser printers are usually desinged\nfor higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product\nreplacement cycles.\n\n\n-- \nBill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services Department\nRootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511\nwtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED\n&quot;, &apos;From: gnome@pd.org (Mike Mitten)\nSubject: Re: What is it with Cats and Dogs ???!\nOrganization: The Laughing Gnome Software Farm, Atlanta, GA, USA\nLines: 13\nNNTP-Posting-Host: noel.pd.org\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6]\n\njames.bessette (jimbes@cbnewsj.cb.att.com) wrote:\n&gt;In article &lt;6130328@hplsla.hp.com&gt; kens@hplsla.hp.com (Ken Snyder) writes:\n&gt;&gt;ps.

Analogue scopes give you (or me, at\n|&gt; least) a fair idea of what\&apos;s going on in a circuit. Digital scopes\n|&gt; seem to have a habit of inventing a sizable part of it. E.g. even\n|&gt; when there are only a few samples per period, our HP54510A displays a\n|&gt; continuous waveform, complete with non-existing overshoots. I\&apos;ve\n|&gt; waded through lots of manual pages and menus, but I haven\&apos;t found yet\n|&gt; how to turn this off. It doesn\&apos;t show which points have actually\n|&gt; been measured, as opposed to those which have been interpolated,\n|&gt; either.\n\nPerhaps you\&apos;re using the wrong brand! (Sorry all HP fans, but I have\na hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their\n(excellent) gear).\n\nOne of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is\nwhether you can turn interpolation off. The other important feature\nis to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock\nthe instrument into real time capture mode.\n\n|&gt; \n|&gt; Secondly, I don\&apos;t like menus. I want to see all common functions\n|&gt; with their own button. (You\&apos;ll have guessed I love analogue Tek\n|&gt; scopes) I\&apos;d choose a knob with printed legend over an on-screen\n|&gt; display with up-down buttons right away. The single knob of most\n|&gt; digital instruments never seems to be connected to the right function\n|&gt; at the right moment.\n|&gt; \n\nI agree with you here. The only consolation is that manufacturers are\n_beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus.\nHowever, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students)\nseem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or\nmore knobs required of a &quot;real&quot; scope :-)\n\n|&gt; Last but not least, you never know if the waveform displayed is old\n|&gt; or recent, noisy or just incoherently modulated, heck, you don\&apos;t\n|&gt; even know if it really looks the way it\&apos;s displayed. Digital scopes\n|&gt; only show you a tiny fraction of what\&apos;s going on. Most of the time\n|&gt; the\&apos;re busy computing things.\n\nThis is one area that newer DSOs are addressing. I recently evaluated\nthe latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy\nalternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has\na 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time\ncapture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in\nthe range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at\nleast they appear to be logically laid out.\n|&gt; \n|&gt; There are only three situations for which I would prefer a digital\n|&gt; scope: Looking at what happened before the trigger, looking at rare\n|&gt; events, and acquiring the data to have my computer play with it.\n|&gt; \n|&gt; \n|&gt; Let\&apos;s hope scope manufacturers are listening...\n|&gt; \n|&gt; Best regards,\n|&gt; Jeroen Belleman\n|&gt; jeroen@dxcern.cern.ch\n\nOne more thing about the new, &quot;simpler&quot;, front panels. These instruments\ntend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement\nover the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our\nscopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these\nswitches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the\nlongevity of the instruments.\n\nJohnH\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\/           School of MPCE\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\n\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&apos;, &apos;From: griffin@camelot.bradley.edu (Mark Valentine)\nSubject: HELP: 20ma current loop to RS232 converter needed.\nSummary: I need a device that will convert 20ma current loop to RS232.\nKeywords: 20,current,loop,converter,rs232\nNntp-Posting-Host: camelot.bradley.edu\nOrganization: Bradley University\nDistribution: usa\nLines: 10\n\n\n\tWhere can I buy or build a device that will convert 20 ma\ncurrent loop signals to RS232 voltages?

The question is,\n&gt;is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to\n&gt;design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and\n&gt;see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of\n&gt;us who have bikes are familiar.\n\nAs you point out, the experiments would be difficult. But we know\nenough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations.\nThere are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over\nto begin a turn.\n\n\t1. Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over.\n\n\t2. Contact patch having shifted to one side, causing bike to fall over.\n\n\t3. Contact patch being accelerated to the side, causing a\n\ttorque which twists the bike over.\n\nTake an average bike/rider, average bike wheel, and at speeds of 5,\n15, and 50 mph (say) calculate how much twist of the bars would be\nneeded to produce (say) 20 degrees of lean in (say) 2 seconds by each\neffect alone. My guess is that at slow speeds 2 is dominant, and at\nhigh speeds 3 is dominant, and at all speeds 1 contributes not far off\nbugger all, relatively speaking.\n\nBy the way, a similar problem is this: how does a runner who wants to\nrun round a corner get leaned into the corner fast? Is there a running\ngroup where we could start &quot;counter-footing&quot; arguments and have them\nall falling over as they tried to work out how they go round corners?\n-- \nChris Malcolm    cam@uk.ac.ed.aifh          +44 (0)31 650 3085\nDepartment of Artificial Intelligence,    Edinburgh University\n5 Forrest Hill, Edinburgh, EH1 2QL, UK                DoD #205\n&apos;, &quot;From: seth@north1.acpub.duke.edu (Seth Wandersman)\nSubject: Oak Driver NEEDED (30d studio)\nReply-To: seth@north1.acpub.duke.edu (Seth Wandersman)\nLines: 8\nNntp-Posting-Host: north1.acpub.duke.edu\n\n\n\tHi, I&apos;m looking for the 3-D studio driver for the\n\tOak card with 1 M of RAM.\n\tThis would be GREATLY (and I mean that) appreciated\n\n\tMaybe I should have just gotten a more well know card.\nthanks\nseth@acpub.duke.edu\n&quot;, &quot;From: lmp8913@rigel.tamu.edu (PRESTON, LISA M)\nSubject: Another CVIEW question (was CView answers)\nOrganization: Texas A&amp;M University, Academic Computing Services\nLines: 12\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: rigel.tamu.edu\nNews-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41    \n\n\n\tHas anybody gotten CVIEW to work in 32k or 64k color mode on a Trident\n8900c hi-color card?

It\&apos;s not fully\nup to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different\nmanufacturer\&apos;s synonyms):\n\n------\nIn practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view\nof the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences my\nviews on things like availability and backward compatibility):\n\n74\tThe original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively\n\tobsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball\n\tfunctions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.\n\n74H\tModification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher\n\tpower consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.\n\n74L\tModification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.\n\tVery obsolete; use CMOS.\n\n74S\tLater modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in\n\tpower consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.\n\n74LS\tCombination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower\n\tpower consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of\n\tdevices.\n\n74F\tFast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high\n\tspeed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.\n\n74AS\tFailed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things\n\tthat are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.\n\n74ALS\tPossible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly\n\tnew, availability and prices possibly a problem.\n\n74C\tFairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with\n\t4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer\n\tCMOS 74 families.\n\n4000\t(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS\n\tfamily, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low\n\tpower consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.\n\tVery forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,\n\tbut that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).\n\tThere are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The\n\tclear choice when speed is not important.\n\n74HC\tA new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power\n\tconsumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for\n\tgeneral-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.\n\tCMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of\n\tsupply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power\n\tconsumption at faster speeds.\n\n74HCT\t74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read\n\tthe fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility\n\tin CMOS involves some compromises.\n\n10K\t(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources\n\tclaim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for\n\tserious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow\n\tthe rules or it won\&apos;t work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,\n\tcan be expensive.\n\n100K\t(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and\n\tinconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.\n\nAs for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and\n74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices\nyou can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just\nhave to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible\nwith the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of\nhassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.\n10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.\n\nMe?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are\ninteresting but I haven\&apos;t used either significantly yet.\n-- \nAll work is one man\&apos;s work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology\n                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry\n&apos;, &quot;From: infante@acpub.duke.edu (Andrew  Infante)\nSubject: Re: Countersteering_FAQ please post\nOrganization: Duke University; Durham, N.C.\nLines: 37\nNntp-Posting-Host: north1.acpub.duke.edu\n\nIn article &lt;05APR93.02678944.0049@UNBVM1.CSD.UNB.CA&gt; C70A@UNB.CA (C70A000) writes:\n&gt;In article &lt;C4zKCL.FGC@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu&gt; Eric@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu (93CBR900RR) writes:\n&gt;&gt;Would someone please post the countersteering FAQ...i am having this awful\n&gt;&gt;time debating with someone on why i push the right handle of my motorcycle\n&gt;&gt;foward when i am turning left...and i can&apos;t explain (well at least) why this\n&gt;&gt;happens...please help...post the faq...i need to convert him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ummm, if you push on the right handle of your bike while at speed and\n&gt;your bike turns left, methinks your bike has a problem.

My head (helmeted)\nhit the pavement with a &quot;clunk&quot;, leaving a couple of dings and chips in the\npaint at the point of impact, but no other visible damage.  I called the\nhelmet manufacturer and inquired about damage.  They said that the way a\nfiberglass shell works is to first give, then delaminate, then crack.\nThis is the way fiberglass serves to spread the force of the impact over a\nwider area.  After the fiberglass has done its thing, the crushable foam\nliner takes care of absorbing (hopefully) the remaining impact force.\nThey told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality (delamination\nof the glass/resin layers) can occur with NO visible signs, either inside or\noutside of the helmet.  They suggested that I send them the helmet and they\nwould inspect it (including X-raying).  I did so.  They sent back the helmet\nwith a letter stating that that they could find no damage that would\ncompromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection.\n(I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim\nprior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them.)\n\nThe bottom line, though, is that it appears that a helmets integrity\ncan be compromised with no visible signs.  The only way to know for sure\nis to send it back and have it inspected.  Note that some helmet\nmanufacturers provide inspections services and some do not.

I\&apos;d\nlike to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to\nuse cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation\nconsoles date from the early 60\&apos;s and don\&apos;t provide this function.\n\nWe already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes,\nand our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control\ncircuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.\n\nI\&apos;ve tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the\ncue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there\&apos;s one\nproblem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be\na sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute,\nso to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid\ncuetape!)\n\nIdeally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function.\n(A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film)\nThis would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second.\nWhat I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay\nfor around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay\nis activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit\nof some sort.  I\&apos;m sure some of you already have the solution figured\nout in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMark Fontana\n\n-- \n &quot;Of all the arts, the cinema is  |  Mark A.

It is a &apos;75 850-T. The tires that\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\n\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\ntube qualities?\n\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\n\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\n\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn&apos;t looked at the rim to\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\nI havn&apos;t had a chance to check the rim type.\n\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\nI would like a simple rounded cafe&apos; style quarter fairing for it. It could be\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe&apos; style for this bike? How about lower\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe&apos;\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\n\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

Here\&apos;s my question.  It seems to me that I\&apos;d have the\n&gt;&gt;same electrical circuit if I hooked the neutral jumper from the\n&gt;&gt;neutral over to the ground screw on new \&apos;three prong\&apos; grounding\n&gt;&gt;outlets. What\&apos;s wrong with my reasoning here?\n\n&gt;First, go to the local hardware store and pick up a copy of &quot;Wiring\n&gt;Simplified&quot; by H.L. Richter.  Now if your house is wired with metal\n&gt;conduit, you don\&apos;t need a seperate ground wire (assuming the house\n&gt;is wired correctly and the pipes are connected to a cold water\n&gt;pipe in your basement).  The outlets that have a neutral hooked to\n&gt;the ground screw seem wrong.  Anyone else think so?\n\nBack in the 70\&apos;s I was a service technician for a cash register company.\nThe cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were\nVERY susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise.  The biggest\nproblems came from outlets that were not properly grounded.\n\nIn almost every place we went to do an installation, we found outlets\nwith the ground connected to the neutral.  For 99.9% of the things you\ncan plug into one of these, they work fine.  For our cash registers they\nwere a nightmare -- line noise tended to scramble the memory\nperiodically.\n\nWith modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be\nless of a problem.  Even the company I used to work for is no longer\nrecommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their\nequipment.  I imagine if you check MOST household wiring you will find\nthat the ground and neutral are connected.  Although not ideal, it\nshould be o.k. for most applications.\n\n---\n . SLMR 2.1 .

Well, I now have the\nopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have\nsome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.\n\nThe main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to\nturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle\ncomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple\npolygons). For example, in the letter &quot;O&quot; there are two outlines:\n\n\t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)\n\t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.\n\nOne common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply \nconnect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the\ntwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a &quot;polygon with\nholes&quot;. The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior\npolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.\n\nI do not want to use this simplistic system since:\n\n\t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple\n\t\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for\n\t\tsome fancy fonts).\n\t2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.\n\nFrom my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid\ndecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as\nis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal\npolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.\n\nMy question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into\npolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution\nsince it creates excess number of polygons.\n\nAnother question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create\nbevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on these\nsubjects but I can\&apos;t tell which method is the best to implement.\n\nThanks for any pointers.\n\n--&gt; Rob Lansdale\n\n-- \nRobert Lansdale - (416) 978-6619       Dynamic Graphics Project\t\nInternet: lansd@dgp.toronto.edu        Computer Systems Research Institute\nUUCP:   ..!uunet!dgp.toronto.edu!lansd University of Toronto\nBitnet:\t  lansd@dgp.utoronto           Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A4, CANADA\n&apos;, &quot;From: mdgoodma@apgea.army.mil (Malcolm D.

OK ?\nLet me try to explain what that tower is used to:\n   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.\n         It has an hightech &quot;boiler&quot; but the rest is still verry verry \n         conventional. And if you\&apos;ve already visited any condensation-\n         powerstation you\&apos;l have seen the cooling towers too.\n         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you\&apos;ll find\n         a chapter about the &quot;CARNOT-process&quot; which describes how to\n         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason\n         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you\&apos;ve an\n         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one \n         side and need to cool down the steam \&apos;till you get water\n         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the \n         energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to\n         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and &quot;cold&quot;\n         steam on the other side you\&apos;ll loose much more of the energy.\n         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of\n         energy that carnot will give them.\n         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !\n         The vapor you\&apos;ll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,\n         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in\n         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent\n         radioactive pollution of the environment !\n         \n   -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-\n         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still\n         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere\n         around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you\&apos;ll have lot\&apos;s of problems with\n         the boiler\&apos;s steel. That\&apos;s because at this temperature the\n         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.\n         This is only for BWR\&apos;s. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures\n         up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental. \n\n   -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever\n         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the\n         years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won\&apos;t be 0.75 mRem\n         at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you\&apos;ll still have\n         1.5 mRem.

On the drawing you have a set of\nreference points whose true x,y positions are known.  \n\nNow you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using Yaron\nDanon\&apos;s excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program which\nconverts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click\nthe mouse.\n\nUpon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come\nout of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways\nfrom the known true values.  This is understandable because the\nscanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are\nsuccessive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and\ncontraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process,\nscanner errors and what have you.\n\nThe errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so &quot;global&quot;\nadjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or\nrotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.\n\nSo the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for\nremoving such distortion?  In particular, if I have three sets of\npoints \n\nReference(x,y) (the known true values)\n\nDistortedReference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)\n\nDistortedData(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)\n\nwhat function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to\nDistortedData to remove the errors.\n\nI suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted\nreference points as resulting from the projection of a &quot;bumpy&quot; 3d\nsurface, solving for the surface and then &quot;flattening&quot; it to remove\nthe errors in the other data points.\n\nAny kind and informed soul out there have any ideas, or better yet,\npointers to treatments of the same or similar problems?\n\nThanks,\n\nEarl\n\n\n&apos;, &apos;From: tcora@pica.army.mil (Tom Coradeschi)\nSubject: Re: Observation re: helmets\nOrganization: Elect Armts Div, US Army Armt RDE Ctr, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ\nLines: 17\nNntp-Posting-Host: b329-gator-3.pica.army.mil\n\nmaven@mavenry.altcit.eskimo.com (Norman Hamer) wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Grf.

I come at this from nuclear physics, where one often discusses \n&gt;particle-hole excitations and certain reactions have the effect of \n&gt;applying an annihilation operator and creating a hole, and it is a \n&gt;subtle question.  The longer one works with them, the more real they \n&gt;become.  There are also quasi-particles, which raise the same sort \n&gt;of question about how &quot;real&quot; the entity is.  The phenomenon is most \n&gt;certainly a real one. \n\nOK, I\&apos;ve asked this before, and with a new thread on these lines, I\nask this again:\n\n1: If a large hole current is run thru a resistor, will there be\n   I^2 * R cooling instead of heating?\n\n2: Can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplifies\n   hole currents over normal electron currents?\n\n3: what semiconductor materials have the highest ratio of\n   hole mobility to electron mobility? (please quote actual\n   test samples rather than estimates based on theory. Also,\n   don\&apos;t be limited to semiconductors: consider also insulators,\n   resistors, dielectrics, piezo-electrics, conductors,\n   magnets (metal, ceramic), magnetostrictives, etc).\n\nNOTES:\n\n   to summarize, this thread has so far stated that the only area\n   where holes are not detectable is the vacuum. That is, hole\n   particles only exist in the presence of matter.\n   Previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain\n   semi-conductors. The question that naturally arises is if\n   the hole currents inside a semi-conductor vanish at the point\n   where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor (say, copper).\n   I don\&apos;t want a theoretical discussion here about whether\n   holes could exist inside metal conductors, rather I ask for\n   an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such\n   currents *if* they exist.\n   Also note that I have cross-posted this to sci.electronics\n   since this is now becoming an electronic discussion.\n\nThanx,\nEric.\n\n----\n ET   &quot;A Force of Nature&quot;\n----\n&apos;, &quot;From: mz@moscom.com (Matthew Zenkar)\nSubject: Re: CView answers\nOrganization: Moscom Corp., E.

Are you seriously\n&gt;suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster\n&gt;or more competentlY than you could manage otherwise??\n\nIf he\&apos;s not, I will.  Put two riders on identical machines.  It\&apos;s the\none who knows what he\&apos;s doing, and why, that will be faster.  It *may*\nbe possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is,\nthrough trial and error, but it is not very effective methodology.\nOnly by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one\nimprove on that technique (I hold that this applies to any human\nendeavor).\n\n&gt;that\&apos;s all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that\n&gt;it is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster\n&gt;or better as a result, is absurd.\n\nDo you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd?\nAre you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management\npolicy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or\ndecrease available traction?  Braking?\n\nIt is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum\nswerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques.  For most\nof his riding life this may not be a problem, but in an emergency\nsituation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage.\n\n&gt;But by including countersteering\n&gt;theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at\n&gt;the time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn.\n\nI disagree.  The existance and immense success of riding courses which\nteach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner\nthat is neither confusing, nor detracts from any other aspects of the\ncourse.\n\n&gt;And that was my original point.\n\nPerhaps, but in the ensuing discussion, you strayed far from that\npoint, to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to a\nrider\&apos;s ability.

There are certain things about the way\n&gt; the plate tektoniks and volcanic activity effect a land scape that\n&gt; is, while not entirely random, unpredictable.  This is also true with\n&gt; fractals, so one could also conclude that you could model this\n&gt; fractally. \n\nYeah, and it\&apos;s also true most long complicated sequences of events,\ncalculations, or big computer programs in general.  I don\&apos;t argue\nthat you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I\njust question whether you &gt;should&lt;.\n\nThe fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we\ncan\&apos;t model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That\nhas been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human\nperception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don\&apos;t\nthink it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather\nthat the model be improved in a more explicable manner.\n\nI guess I just haven\&apos;t seen all these earth-shaking fractal models\nthat explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.

If it\&apos;s so\ngreat, how come we don\&apos;t see it competing with JPEG?  \&apos;Cause it can\&apos;t,\nI\&apos;ll wager.\n\nActually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression\nwork- and I was trying- because I don\&apos;t think it\&apos;s a reasonable\nalternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)\n\nI\&apos;ll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That\&apos;s why I\ndon\&apos;t think fractal compression as it is widely explained is\npractical.

Finally,\nthe 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, \nbecame warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I\ntook a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.\nThey had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours\nbefore I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom --\nsurrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.\n\nToday was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,\n50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat\nTouring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.\nSome sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one\nMSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on\nthe back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that\nCycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like\na big moto party.\n\nAfter about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,\nand another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/\npray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the\nparking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from \nthe Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else\ninto the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the \nST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of\nthe road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a\nbicycle!  \&apos;It cant be that heavy\&apos; I thought.\n\nWell I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could \nthink was &quot;big&quot;.  Then I put one foot up.  &quot;Heavy&quot; came to mind very\nquickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to \ntell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed\nnearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.\n\nBy 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even\non bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that \ndid not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is\non a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north\nof the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95\nsplits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access\nhighway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, \nManchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.\nOn its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about\n30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many\nthoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.\n\nCindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along\nin top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane \nchanges were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this \nthing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the\nfairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was\nnon-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.\nSmooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,\nbut it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless\nbuzz.\n\nThe jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the\nbrakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,\ndecreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  \nThe section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok\nin this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack\noft featured in &quot;Spencer for Hire&quot; -- a place where you could really \nfind &quot;Spencer&quot;, his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting\nthrough traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.\n\nAbout half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy\&apos;s wrist, our singal\nfor &quot;hold on tight&quot;.  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second\ngear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a \nshort shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light\ntraffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.\nWell, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort\nlane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went \nuntil the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed\nthere.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, \nI looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.\n\nBeverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the &quot;get\noff in a mile&quot; sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted\nto re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were\nseveral manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the \nslow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could \nsee even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed\nto thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad\nout front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put\nthe thing on the center stand.

Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these\ndraw too much current and burn out the blinker.

If there\&apos;s heat involved, anybody know what temperature they run at\n&gt;My wife would like one and I\&apos;m not inclined to pay &gt;$100.00 for a box, a fan\n&gt;and a heater. Seems to me you should be able to throw a dehydrator together\n&gt;for just a few bucks. Heck, the technology is only what? 1,000 years old?\n\nYou can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book, &quot;The\nHungry Hiker\&apos;s Guide to Good Food,&quot; by Gretchen McHugh.  The heat source\nis a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it\&apos;s a vertical wooden box with\nventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the air\nto flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks are\nspaced every 6&quot; starting about 10&quot; above the bulb.\n\nOr, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Use\nyour oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens may\nnot have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins or\nracks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on my\noven - if yours goes down to 120 that\&apos;s probably even better.)  Stick a\nwooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close\nthe door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allows\nfor airflow.  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check it\noften, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.  If you are\nusing cookie sheets instead of racks, turn the stuff over halfway\nthrough.\n\nIf you want more info, e-mail me since this isn\&apos;t really the right sub\nfor this stuff.\n\ngerald.belton@ozonehole.com\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1 * I still miss my boss, but my aim is improving.\n                       \n----\nThe Ozone Hole BBS * A Private Bulletin Board Service * (504)891-3142\n3 Full Service Nodes * USRobotics 16.8K bps * 10 Gigs * 100,000 Files\nSKYDIVE New Orleans! * RIME Network Mail HUB * 500+ Usenet Newsgroups\nPlease route all questions or inquiries to:  postmaster@ozonehole.com\n&apos;, &apos;From: mcovingt@aisun3.ai.uga.edu (Michael Covington)\nSubject: Re: Where to buy parts 1 or 2 at a time?\nNntp-Posting-Host: aisun3.ai.uga.edu\nOrganization: AI Programs, University of Georgia, Athens\nLines: 15\n\nThe pricing of parts reminds me of something a chemist once said to me:\n\n&quot;A gram of this dye costs a dollar.\nIt comes out of a liter jar which also costs a dollar.\nAnd if you want a whole barrel of it, that also costs a dollar.&quot;\n\nI.e., they charge you almost exclusively for packaging it and delivering\nit to you -- the chemical itself (in that particular case) was a byproduct\nthat cost almost nothing intrinsically.\n\n-- \n:-  Michael A.

We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in\naddition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray\nlevel images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to\nformat the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial\nproblems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a\nparallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4\nbit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the\n256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video\nsignal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they\ndid say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but\nthey didn&apos;t have any information about how to program it to do so, and they\nwould call Japan, etc.\n\nFrankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images\nfrom the video source, it can&apos;t store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It&apos;s not\nlike memory is that expensive any more.

If\nyou are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will\nnot be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. \nThe fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle\n(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of\nthe law is no excuse - they will get you too!\n\nIt used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for\nan officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many\nlaw enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. \nRight, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF\nfrom the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was &quot;no way!&quot; \nBut, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police\nare writing citations right and left for people using radar\ndetectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had\nfound the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,\nand he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was\nthere.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.\n\nNow, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or\nnear the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me\nfrom getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my\nspeed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar\ndetector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which\nis what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to\nobey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.\n\nFor my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only\nworks in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave\nenlightment may be necessary.\n\nSo, the questions are -\n  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?\n  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by\n  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector\n  antenna?\n  Are any brands &quot;quieter&quot; than others?\n\n==============================================================================\nRandy T.

What exactly do you want to know?  Do you need a good\n&gt;one for a project you are working on?  How secure must it be?  Are you trying\n&gt;to crack one that someone else has used?  I can probably make suggestions,\n&gt;assuming the activity is strictly legal.  (In general, it is a BAD idea,\n&gt;legally, to tamper with copy protection.  It can also lead to corruption of\n&gt;files which you necessarily do not have back ups of (being as they are copy\n&gt;protected,) which can be devestating.)

What the supply must do,\nif presented with a load which would draw more than 1A, given the\nsupply voltage, is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal\none amp.  Thus, if we were to short the thing with the ammeter, we\nshould read one amp.  If we measure the current through a 1 ohm \nresistor at 12V, we should read one amp (and the output voltage, by\nnecessity, must be 1V.\n\nThe only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves\na circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output \npower transistor, and therefore reduce the output.\n\nSo, does anybody have any ideas we could work from?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nAndy Collins, KC6YEY\nacollins@uclink.berkeley.edu\n\nps: If anybody wants to flame this as a stupid project, I agree fully,\n    but I still have to do it, its graded ;^)\n\n&quot;, &apos;From: sean@dip1.ee.uct.ac.za (Sean Borman)\nSubject: INFO WANTED : Graphics LCD displays\nOrganization: University of Cape Town\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]\nLines: 15\n\n\nHi there\n\nDoes anyone know how to get hold of data as well as stock of the\nLCD displays used in the NINTENDO GAMEBOY handheld TV game machines?\n\nAny information wouold be MOST appreciated.\n\nPlease e-mail any replies to \n\narawstorne@eleceng.uct.ac.za\n\nthanks\n\nAlex\n&apos;, &apos;From: ak954@yfn.ysu.edu (Albion H.

I was wondering if anyone out there knows of a\nDRAM controller which will handle refreshing the data.  It&apos;s ok if the\ncontroller doesn&apos;t handle bank switching - that part is easy.\n\nThe only controllers I know of are the ones out of the National\nSemiconductor DRAM Management Handbook (1988 edition) eg. DP8429.  I would\nlike to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to\nimplement in my circuit.\n\nBTW, if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller, Dallas\nSemiconductor makes a neat chip: the DS1262 Serial DRAM Nonvolatizer\nChip.  It uses the SPI (I2C) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16Mx1 of DRAM\nmemory.  It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when the\npower is off.  Price is $11.75 from Dallas (quan 1).  I wish I could use\nthis chip but its maximum SPI clock rate is 1 MHz (too slow for me...).\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nWayne Schellekens\n&lt;schellew@wu2.wl.aecl.ca&gt;\n-- \nWayne Schellekens, VE4WTS          Internet: schellew@wu2.wl.aecl.ca\nAECL Research                         AX.25: VE4WTS@VE4KV.#WPG.MB.CAN \nWhiteshell Laboratories        Twisted pair: (204)753-2311 x2317\n&quot;, &apos;From: ai598@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Mike Sturdevant)\nSubject: Re: Ed must be a Daemon Child!!\nArticle-I.D.: usenet.1pqhvu$go8\nReply-To: ai598@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Mike Sturdevant)\nOrganization: Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH (USA)\nLines: 22\nNNTP-Posting-Host: slc10.ins.cwru.edu\n\n\nIn a previous article, svoboda@rtsg.mot.com (David Svoboda) says:\n\n&gt;In article &lt;1993Apr2.163021.17074@linus.mitre.org&gt; cookson@mbunix.mitre.org (Cookson) writes:\n&gt;|\n&gt;|Wait a minute here, Ed is Noemi AND Satan?

But here\&apos;s a brief summary...\n\nPHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many\ndevices.  Most implementations support the X Window System and take\nadvantage of a 3D extension to X called &quot;PEX&quot;.  PEXlib is a slightly\n&quot;lower&quot; level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX\nextension to X.\n\nSome advantages of using PEXlib...\n- Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS\n- Provides immediate mode capabilities\n- Is free of &quot;policy&quot;\n- PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support\n  features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).\n  PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.\n\nSome advantages of using PHIGS...\n- Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones\n- Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output\n- PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier\n- PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you\n- PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.\n\nIf you\&apos;re working strictly in X and don\&apos;t care about things like\narchiving, I would go with PEXlib.

Do an intersection calculation in the plane in\n2D, where you&apos;re guaranteed a unique solution (unless they&apos;re parallel which\nwon&apos;t happen in this case), and then use parametric distance along the lines\nfrom the circle centres to determine the exact point of interest.

Our agency started to express interest in\n|&gt; virtual reality(VR).  So far, we do not know much about VR.  All we\n|&gt; know about are the Hollywood movies &quot;The Terminater 2&quot; and &quot;Lawnmover\n|&gt; Man&quot;.  We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and\n|&gt; Computer Graphics World magazine.\n\n\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\nper second).\n\n\n|&gt; \n|&gt; We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading\n|&gt; companies,\n|&gt; agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4,\n|&gt; HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?\n\n\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\ndata representations.\n\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\neven SGI\&apos;s uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\n\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\n\n\n|&gt;  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR\n|&gt; (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?\n\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level. There are\noff-the- shelf software packages available to get you going much faster,\nbeing targeted directly at the VR application developer. Some of the most\npopular are (in no particular order):\n\n\t- Division Inc.\t\t    (Redwood City, CA) - dVS\n\t- Sens8 Inc.\t\t    (Sausalito, CA)    - WorldToolKit\n\t- Naval Postgraduate School (Monterey, CA)     - NPSnet (FREE!)\n\t- Gemini Technology Corp    (Irvine, CA)       - GVS Simation Series\n\t- Paradigm Simulation Inc.

How are those orange &quot;isolated ground&quot; outlets (often used in\n&gt;computer rooms) wired?  \n\nThey require two separate grounds.  One ground goes to the ground pin\nof the outlet, and the other ground wire is connected to the outlet\&apos;s\nmounting tabs (and thus grounds the box and faceplate screw and metal\nfaceplate, if any).\n\nThe box/faceplate ground goes to the normal distribution panel ground.\nThe outlet ground-pin wire is generally connected to an insulated\nbusbar in the distribution panel which is, in turn, connected to\nthe building-entrance main ground by its own wire.\n\nSo the two separate ground systems are connected together at the\nbuilding\&apos;s service entrance.  But one is also connected to every\ngrounded piece of electrical equipment in the whole building,\nwhile the isolated ground is shared only by the equipment plugged\ninto isolated-ground outlets of that panel.  If someone happens\nto accidentally short one phase of a 600V feeder to ground,\nthe main building ground is likely to have a lot of noise on it\nuntil the breaker trips or the fuse blows, while the isolated\nground will remain relatively noise-free.\n&apos;, &quot;From: razor@swix.nvg.unit.no (Runar Jordahl)\nSubject: Re: Help!

While what you state is true, it\n&gt;is insufficient to form a traction management policy.  Available\n&gt;traction increases with applied normal force, ie, traction available to\n&gt;the front wheel increases as weight shifts under braking forces, and\n&gt;correspondingly decreases at the rear.  Thus, a *technique* of applying\n&gt;both brakes, and easing off the rear and increasing pressure on the\n&gt;front, can best be learned with an understanding of weight shift and\n&gt;available traction.\n\nJeez, Ed, when you started talking about traction management policies I\nthought you were making some weird reference to looking after railway\nlocomotives...\n\nThe official line here (though I do have my doubts about it) is that the\nfront brake is applied first, followed by the rear brake, the idea being\nthat you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place. In\npractice I suspect most people do what you describe.\n\n&gt;Saying, &quot;brake until the tire just begins to slide&quot; is next to useless\n&gt;advice to a newbie.  He has to go out and slide the tire to find out\n&gt;where that is!  It also gives him zero information from which to\n&gt;develop a braking technique that changes as the braking and\n&gt;corresponding weight shift develop.\n\nIf you don\&apos;t slide the tyre, you have no way of knowing whether you\&apos;ve\nachieved maximum braking or not. I\&apos;m not suggesting that you should always\naim to brake as hard as you possibly can - but if you want to find the\nlimits of the machine, you have to go beyond them. \n\nIn any case, for maximum braking, if (as I suggested) you aim to keep\nboth wheels just on the point of sliding, then you\&apos;ll be doing\nexactly as *you* suggest!!\n\n\n\n\n&apos;, &quot;From: bernard@cs.su.oz.au (Bernard Gardner)\nSubject: Re: Fast polygon routine needed\nOrganization: Basser Department of Computer Science\nKeywords: polygon, needed\nLines: 10\n\nFor some reason I never saw the original post on this thread, but if you are\nlooking for fast polygon routines on vga on a PC, you really can&apos;t go past\nthe mode X stuff from Dr Dobbs.

I hear that they\&apos;re called\n&gt;\&apos;Cooling Towers\&apos; but what the heck do they cool?\n\nExcept for their size, the cooling towers on nuclear power plants\nare vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling\ntowers designed and built in the 1890\&apos;s (a hundred years ago) for\ncoal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways.\n\nBasicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when\nits air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network\nof pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist cooling\nand the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the\nhot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than\njust air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is\nrapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently\nseen rising out of these towers.\n\nThat slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because\nit produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of\nthe air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.\n\nThe towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam\nsystem of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the\nboiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across\nthe turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and\nby recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it\nback to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference\n(sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage &quot;hot&quot;\nturbine to final stage &quot;cold&quot; turbine).\n\n                                        R.

The first one,\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\nextractors such as :class:`sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\nextractor.\n\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\n\n    =================   ==========\n    Classes                     20\n    Samples total            18846\n    Dimensionality               1\n    Features                  text\n    =================   ==========\n\nUsage\n~~~~~\n\nThe :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function is a data\nfetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from\nthe original `20 newsgroups website`_, extracts the archive contents\nin the ``~/scikit_learn_data/20news_home`` folder and calls the\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.load_files` on either the training or\ntesting set folder, or both of them::\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\&apos;train\&apos;)\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; from pprint import pprint\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; pprint(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))\n  [\&apos;alt.atheism\&apos;,\n   \&apos;comp.graphics\&apos;,\n   \&apos;comp.os.ms-windows.misc\&apos;,\n   \&apos;comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\&apos;,\n   \&apos;comp.sys.mac.hardware\&apos;,\n   \&apos;comp.windows.x\&apos;,\n   \&apos;misc.forsale\&apos;,\n   \&apos;rec.autos\&apos;,\n   \&apos;rec.motorcycles\&apos;,\n   \&apos;rec.sport.baseball\&apos;,\n   \&apos;rec.sport.hockey\&apos;,\n   \&apos;sci.crypt\&apos;,\n   \&apos;sci.electronics\&apos;,\n   \&apos;sci.med\&apos;,\n   \&apos;sci.space\&apos;,\n   \&apos;soc.religion.christian\&apos;,\n   \&apos;talk.politics.guns\&apos;,\n   \&apos;talk.politics.mideast\&apos;,\n   \&apos;talk.politics.misc\&apos;,\n   \&apos;talk.religion.misc\&apos;]\n\nThe real data lies in the ``filenames`` and ``target`` attributes. The target\nattribute is the integer index of the category::\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\n  (11314,)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train.target.shape\n  (11314,)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train.target[:10]\n  array([ 7,  4,  4,  1, 14, 16, 13,  3,  2,  4])\n\nIt is possible to load only a sub-selection of the categories by passing the\nlist of the categories to load to the\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function::\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; cats = [\&apos;alt.atheism\&apos;, \&apos;sci.space\&apos;]\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\&apos;train\&apos;, categories=cats)\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; list(newsgroups_train.target_names)\n  [\&apos;alt.atheism\&apos;, \&apos;sci.space\&apos;]\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\n  (1073,)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train.target.shape\n  (1073,)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train.target[:10]\n  array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\n\nConverting text to vectors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn order to feed predictive or clustering models with the text data,\none first need to turn the text into vectors of numerical values suitable\nfor statistical analysis. This can be achieved with the utilities of the\n``sklearn.feature_extraction.text`` as demonstrated in the following\nexample that extract `TF-IDF`_ vectors of unigram tokens\nfrom a subset of 20news::\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; categories = [\&apos;alt.atheism\&apos;, \&apos;talk.religion.misc\&apos;,\n  ...               \&apos;comp.graphics\&apos;, \&apos;sci.space\&apos;]\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\&apos;train\&apos;,\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectors.shape\n  (2034, 34118)\n\nThe extracted TF-IDF vectors are very sparse, with an average of 159 non-zero\ncomponents by sample in a more than 30000-dimensional space\n(less than .5% non-zero features)::\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectors.nnz / float(vectors.shape[0])\n  159.01327...\n\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized` is a function which \nreturns ready-to-use token counts features instead of file names.\n\n.. _`20 newsgroups website`: http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/\n.. _`TF-IDF`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf\n\n\nFiltering text for more realistic training\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIt is easy for a classifier to overfit on particular things that appear in the\n20 Newsgroups data, such as newsgroup headers. Many classifiers achieve very\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\naren\&apos;t from this window of time.\n\nFor example, let\&apos;s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; from sklearn import metrics\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\&apos;test\&apos;,\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\&apos;macro\&apos;)\n  0.88213...\n\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\nyet of what\&apos;s going on inside this classifier?)\n\nLet\&apos;s take a look at what the most informative features are:\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\n  ...         print(&quot;%s: %s&quot; % (category, &quot; &quot;.join(feature_names[top10])))\n  ...\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\n\n\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\n\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\n- The word &quot;article&quot; is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\n  previous posts like this: &quot;In article [article ID], [name] &lt;[e-mail address]&gt;\n  wrote:&quot;\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\n  were posting at the time.\n\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\nsame high level.\n\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\n``(\&apos;headers\&apos;, \&apos;footers\&apos;, \&apos;quotes\&apos;)``, telling it to remove headers, signature\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\&apos;test\&apos;,\n  ...                                      remove=(\&apos;headers\&apos;, \&apos;footers\&apos;, \&apos;quotes\&apos;),\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\&apos;macro\&apos;)\n  0.77310...\n\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\&apos;train\&apos;,\n  ...                                       remove=(\&apos;headers\&apos;, \&apos;footers\&apos;, \&apos;quotes\&apos;),\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\n  &gt;&gt;&gt; metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\&apos;macro\&apos;)\n  0.76995...\n\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\n\n.. topic:: Recommendation\n\n  When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this by\n  setting ``remove=(\&apos;headers\&apos;, \&apos;footers\&apos;, \&apos;quotes\&apos;)``. The F-score will be\n  lower because it is more realistic.\n\n.. topic:: Examples\n\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\n\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\n&apos;}
